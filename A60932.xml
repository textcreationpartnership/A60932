            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEING a Foreigner, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſtanding in need of a great Patronage, I preſume to beg yours, not only as being a Perſonage of an Elevated Station, but becauſe you are yet more conſiderable for your ſurprizing Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind, and your incomparable Activity and Zeal for the Good of your Country, by which you have merited thoſe Honourable Poſts, that you do ſo worthily fill, and which I have reaſon to-hope, are but the earneſt of greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vancements: But the chief Reaſon why I make bold to trouble your Honour with this Dedication, is, that amongſt the many
<pb facs="tcp:60783:3"/> Perſons of Quality, who have done me the Honour to peruſe this Book in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, and to teſtifie their Approbation of it, there was none who did ſo much encourage me to render it Publick as your ſelf. So that if it be any ways uſeful to the Nation, as I hope it may, they will be obliged to your Honour for it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs Sir, that my firſt intention was to Dedicate it to His Majeſty, as tending very much to the Glory of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by conſequence of his own Royal Diadem, but the meanneſs of my preſent Condition abated my Confidence to ſollicit Acceſs to that great Prince, and therefore, Sir, ſeeing you were always plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, out of your Zeal to the Publick wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, to give me a favourable Reception, notwithſtanding the narrowneſs of my Circumſtances, I reſolved upon this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to your ſelf, as one of His Majeſties moſt faithful Miniſters, which I beg you would accept as a Token of the ſingular Eſteem, and profound Reſpect of,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have obſerved ſeveral times when in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Ingenious Men both Engliſh and Refugees, that neither of them did know the State of this Kingdom, nor that of <hi>France,</hi> and that they did all judge <hi>England</hi> to be leſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, rich and potent, and <hi>France</hi> to be much more populous and rich than really it is, and that they had no right Notions of the preſent condition of <hi>France</hi> and of her Ruine. I obſerved alſo that ſeveral of the Refugees did long eagerly after their return into <hi>France,</hi> not thinking the Nation to be deſtroyed to that degree that it really is, fancying that ſhe may be reſtored eaſily to her former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in a few years, and having in a manner forgot the Cruelties and Prefidiouſneſſes of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church towards them. I obſerved likewiſe, that ſeveral Engliſh and French who have lent Money to the Publick, or to whom ſome may be owing otherwiſe, do vex themſelves by fancying
<pb facs="tcp:60783:4"/> the Affairs of the Kingdom to be in a worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than they really are, becauſe of the preſent ſcarcity of Money; That the <hi>Jacobites</hi> and other Enemies of the Government do harden themſelves in their obſtinacy, thinking the Kingdom not able to maintain the War any longer, and <hi>France</hi> to be ſtill potent enough to diſpoſſeſs K. <hi>VVilliam</hi> by this War, and reſtore the late K. <hi>James,</hi> which makes them ſtill to adhere to that Faction and is partly the cauſe of their frequent Conſpiracies againſt the King's Life, and of ſeveral other diſorders; <hi>France</hi> and her adherents in this Country, deceiving themſelves mutually by making one another believe that they are ſtronger than they are, and fancying that <hi>England</hi> is ruined, which has been perhaps hitherto one of the cauſes of <hi>France</hi>'s delaying to make Peace, becauſe ſhe ſeems to be always in great hopes of ſome fatal ſtroke and revolution in this Kingdom. I confeſs I have alſo been often-times incenſed againſt the French Court, as being the Cauſers of ſo many miſchiefs, and having reduced that flouriſhing Kingdom to nothing, by Cruelties and Treacheries as well againſt their Neighbours as their own Subjects, and of ſo much Blood ſhed every-where in Europe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Reaſons did oblige me about a year ago, to take the Pen in hand, in Order to undeceive ſo many People, which may be a Service to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Allies, Refugees, and all the World, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them plainly, that <hi>France</hi> never was what they took her to be, even in the height of her Proſperity,
<pb facs="tcp:60783:4"/> and that ſhe is utterly ruined now, which is evident enough, from the great Efforts, Advances and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that ſhe makes, notwithſtanding her pride, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtaining a <hi>Peace;</hi> Whereas <hi>England</hi> is ſtill in a hopeful Condition, notwithſtanding the preſent ſcarcity of the Coin.</p>
            <p>After I had made a conſiderable progreſs in the Work, being dubious whether or no I ſhould publiſh it, I thought fit, before I determined any thing, to ſhew it to a Perſon of great Merit, that did Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to ſeveral other Perſons of Quality in the Government, who after the peruſal of it, did exhort me to make it Publick, as being like to be uſeful to the World, and to my ſelf. So that I did look upon thoſe Encouragements, and particularly thoſe that I had from the Honourable Perſon that I Dedicate this Book to, to whom I owe my Life, for had it not been for him I might have ſtarved. I ſay, I did look upon thoſe Encouragements as Orders which I was obliged to obey, becauſe they came from Perſons who had a right to command me.</p>
            <p>Since that time, I have added to it, what the continuation of the War has added to the Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and ſome Events which have happened ſince, and made ſome other ſmall Alterations.</p>
            <p>I queſtion not but thoſe of the Contrary party will oppoſe it, for fear it ſhould prejudice their Faction, and that ſome of my Country-men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, will for that reaſon do me all the
<pb facs="tcp:60783:5"/> ill Offices they can; I have been accuſtomed to thoſe things of a long time.</p>
            <p>I conſider <hi>France</hi> in all reſpects, and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Orders and Ranks of People which are in it; I ſhew plainly the great diſorders of the French Government, which are ſuch that there was perhaps never any Nation amongſt thoſe that are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo ill Governed.</p>
            <p>In the ſeveral manners of conſidering <hi>France,</hi> I am obliged to make uſe of Repetitions, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with ſome diverſity, and never but when the things are not common, but important, and which the Reader might let ſlip. My deſign being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to inſtruct and to be uſeful than to tickle the Ears, or divert thoſe wits who love trifles; So that I deſire that the Things and Reaſons may be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered rather than the VVords.</p>
            <p>There have been diverſe things writ both in French and Engliſh, for ſeveral years paſt upon the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> but leaving thoſe Papers to their own <hi>Merit,</hi> I can ſay, that I have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed nothing from them, that my <hi>Method</hi> is new, and I lay down ſeveral Principles, which they did not, and make a deeper ſearch into things</p>
            <p>As for the Stile, I know ſeveral Galliciſins will be found in it, and other Faults, becauſe I was obliged to Compoſe it my ſelf, being not in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pay a Tranſlator. But yet underſtanding Men will find it plain and intelligible. The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of it I ſhall not accuſe, becauſe it agrees with the ſimplicity of the Matter, as alſo with the Method, which is a kind of <hi>Political Arethme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60783:5"/> And I hope the importance of the Subject, the ſtrength of the Reaſons, and the multitude of Thoughts will make amends for the Imperfection of the Stile.</p>
            <p>Some may be apt to ask, How I can pretend to be ſo well informed of the preſent condition of <hi>France,</hi> ſince I have been ſo long abſent from it, becauſe of the Perſecution. I anſwer, That I had a competent knowledge of the Affairs of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of its Government, and of the State of the People before I left it, and that ſince that time I have taken ſpecial care to obſerve all the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have happened.</p>
            <p>But further, any ſenſible Man who reads my Book, may eaſily perceive that I build all my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions upon Univerſal, Plain and certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, fitted to the meaneſt Capacity, from which I draw my Conſequences, which I ſubmit to any Man's Judgment</p>
            <p>I am confident that ſeveral of my Country men will think it ſtrange, that being of a noted Family in <hi>France,</hi> having ſome Intereſt to manage in that Kingdom, and being uneaſie in <hi>England,</hi> that I ſhould expoſe my ſelf thus, ſeeing the Peace ſeems to be in a great forwardneſs, by Publiſhing ſuch a Book which cannot but highly provoke the Rulers in <hi>France,</hi> who are informed of all things, and ſoon or late will revenge it one way or other. I foreſee all this as well as they; but I think my ſelf obliged to do it in Conſcience and Honour.</p>
            <p>I do not ſee any Reaſon why it ſhould not be as lawful to me, as for ſeveral French Generals and
<pb facs="tcp:60783:6"/> other Officers among the Refugees, who are in the Service of this Nation and other Confederates, to do what I can for the Service of thoſe Nations who have generouſly ſheltered us, againſt thoſe who, inſtead of being our Fathers and Protectors, have behaved themſelves towards us in the moſt barbarous manner againſt all Laws both Divine and Humane. The ſame Motives which influence thoſe good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees, of whom I ſpoke juſt now, induce me to this; If ſo be they deſerve to be commended for what they do, I hope I am not to be blamed for this. It would be a groſs miſtake to think that one may not as uſefully and lawfully ſerve a Nation with his Pen as with his Sword, ſince we deal with Men, who may be perſuaded by Reaſon, and that we can thereby give adviſe at once to Millions of People of what they are to do, expect or fear. A poor Man has ſometimes ſaved a whole Nation, by his good Counſel. If there be any Man ſo unreaſonable as to fancy that becauſe I am a French man Born, I ought out of Conſcience to abſtain from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the weakneſs of <hi>France</hi> as I do, he would be guilty of a groſs errour, to believe that a Prince or a Nation may trample under foot all the Duties of humane Society and Religion, in Relation to their Subjects, and that the Subjects notwithſtanding ſhould not be allowed to make complaints and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Folly and Exceſſes of their <hi>quondam Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> even when they are delivered from under their Bondage; and that the ſame Subjects ſhould not be permitted to ſerve according to their Ability, their Benefactors, under whoſe Protection they live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
<pb facs="tcp:60783:6"/> and worſhip God according to his Word and the light of their Conſcience, to whom moreover, they have ſworn Allegiance and Fidelity, to ſerve 'em, I ſay, against thoſe who have behav'd themſelves towards 'em like ſo many Cruel and Ravenous Wolves, both as to the Affairs of Body and Soul, and behave themſelves still in the ſame manner towards their Brethren in <hi>France,</hi> and ſeem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to be the Univerſal Enemies to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Some may be apt to think that <hi>I</hi> writ this <hi>Book</hi> out of Paſſion and Revenge.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, that never any Reſentment was ſo well grounded as this might be. But yet <hi>I</hi> profeſs that tho' I abhor their conduct and wickedneſs, 'tis not from a Spirit of Revenge that I writ this, and I have already given an Account of the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which induced me to it.</p>
            <p>Any Body may obſerve, there is no Nation to which my Book might be ſo uſeful, as to <hi>France</hi> if ſhe would be pleaſed to follow my Advice.</p>
            <p>I repreſent only the Miſchiefs which her People groans under, but I do her none, but on the contrary, all that I ſay tends naturally to the healing of her diſeaſes, if ſo be ſhe thinks fit to make uſe of the Remedies which <hi>I</hi> propoſe. If any Man ſay that I take a delight in her Calamities and that I ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate them, I declare here in all ſincerity, That I think they are greater than what I ſay, and that I wiſh earneſtly and with all my Soul, that they would repent; And if <hi>France</hi> ever comes to her
<pb facs="tcp:60783:7"/> ſelf, there is no reward ſo great but <hi>I</hi> may deſerve it at her hands for the good Advices I give her. I am ſure that all the honest People of that Kingdom will thank me for it, and 'tis better to pleaſe one honeſt Man in doing my Duty than a Million of ill Men by neglecting it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I reprehend the Exceſſes of the French Government, as I think my ſelf obliged to do in Conſcience and from the principle of Love which I bear to Mankind, and I am of Opinion that if it is commendable to give good Advice to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon by diſcovering his Faults to others and himſelf, it is a thouſand times more commendable to give Advice to a great State, which may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to millions of Souls, and ſometimes to all the World.</p>
            <p>By this Treatiſe the Court of <hi>France</hi> will be better informed than hitherto of the Affairs of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for it would ſeem that they flattered 'emſelves, as if the strength of this Kingdom had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, which is far from the truth, ſeeing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if it will, may be in a better condition than ever.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be obſerved that I ſpeak good of <hi>France</hi> without partiality as well as evil, and that I take the Liberty to reprehend the Faults and Defects of our beſt Friends, for in general <hi>I</hi> hate diſorder, and would have all things go on in their proper courſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:60783:7"/>
            <p>It will be alſo found that <hi>I</hi> have wholly followed a new Method, in diſplaying by Reaſons purely Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, the falſehood of the Romiſh pretended Religion, by its Natural and Perpetual Oppoſition to the good of States, the repoſe of People, and good Morals, which alone is enough to render it deteſtable to all thoſe who love Order, Juſtice and the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of Nations, tho' there were nothing to be ſaid againſt it from the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> hope that equitable Perſons who ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of my good intention and of the uſefulneſs of my labours, will grant me an eaſie pardon for all the Errours, Defects and Imperfections which they may perhaps meet with, ſuch things being common to all Mankind.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THE Ruine and Deſolation of <hi>France</hi> is now become the common Theme of Diſcourſe, and the moſt ordinary Subject of Converſation, eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Refugees</hi> in all Countries where they are diſperſed; but none of thoſe that I have heard diſcourſing about it ſeem to have any juſt Notion of the degree of Oppreſſion which that Kingdom labours under, but all their Ideas are very much below the reality. This, together with my deſire to ſerve the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, hath obliged me to examine the matter thoroughly, and I make bold to ſay, That I have made deeper enquiries into this Matter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60783:9"/> than any body elſe has done, and ſhall now ſubmit my Diſcoveries to the Judgment of the publick.</p>
               <p>I begin with the Diminution of the People of that Kingdom, which I am ſure is much greater than is commonly judged to be; 'tis the chief and moſt important part of the deſolation of <hi>France,</hi> and the great cauſe of all thoſe Evils and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities under which it groans.</p>
               <p>The better to convince the World of the truth of this, I will make uſe of a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already granted; which I think the moſt reaſonable that can be made upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>viz.</hi> That there might be in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> about 14 Millions of Subjects 30 years ago, when it was in its moſt flouriſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there are 27 thouſand Pariſhes in that Kingdom, and it is probable, there might be 500 Souls in each Pariſh, one with another, which makes 13 Millions and a half. I do not here include the Conqueſts, becauſe they do not properly belong to the Kingdom, and 'tis like they will be returned to thoſe to whom they juſtly belong.</p>
               <p>The Computation which I make of there having been 13 Millions and a half of People in <hi>France,</hi> is confirmed by the proportion which there is between the Extent of <hi>France</hi> and that of <hi>England;</hi> as alſo between the number of Pariſhes in the two Kingdoms. <hi>France</hi> contains 82 Millions of Acres, and <hi>England</hi> 30 Millions. There are in <hi>France</hi> 27 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60783:9"/> Pariſhes, as has been ſaid already, and in <hi>England</hi> about 10 thouſand. Now if it be the common eſtimation, that in the 30 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Acres, and the 10 Thouſand Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> there are not above 6 Millions of People; 'tis not probable that there could be in the 82 Millions of Acres, and the 27 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pariſhes in <hi>France,</hi> above 13 Millions and a half, by reaſon that a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Nation under an Arbitrary Government, cannot be ſuppoſed to be ſo well peopled as a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Nation under a Mild Government; beſides ſeveral other Reaſons which I intend to produce here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. So that the Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> may reaſonably be computed to be a ſixth part more populous than thoſe in <hi>France.</hi> So that if the Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> have but 600 Souls one with another, thoſe in <hi>France</hi> could never exceed the number of 500, one with another. In its moſt flouriſhing condition.</p>
               <p>'Tis probable that the <hi>French</hi> King's Subjects decreaſed at leaſt a third part in number, and an half in ſtrength and value. I mean, That tho' the Diminution does not perhaps exceed the Third part as to the number, reckoning the generality of Men, Women, and Children; yet it cannot be leſs than a full half in value, in reſpect that the Adult Men are much more diminiſhed in number than Women; Now it is the number of Men, who without contradiction, makes a People valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſince 'tis they who Cultivate the Land,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60783:10"/> Trade by Sea, imploy themſelves in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and Arts; pay Taxes, and make War: And the Decreaſe is ſo much the more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe the greateſt part of the Men who have been deſtroyed were of that ſort, and not of thoſe who are rather Burthenſome than Profitable to a Nation; of which I ſhall take notice hereafter. Inſomuch that reducing the 13 Millions and an half of Souls to 9 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions at this day, that is, to the two thirds of what they were 30 years ago; 'tis reaſonable to ſay, That there being in this number many more Women and Children proportionably, than Men, the ſaid 9 Millions are not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent worth 6 Millions 750 Thouſand, that is the half of the promiſcuous Maſs of the 13 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and a half, which we ſuppoſed to have been in <hi>France</hi> 30 years ago, becauſe there were then many more Men proportionably than now, eſpecially of that ſort who were imployed in Husbandry, Manufactures, Trade and Handicrafts, of which ſort (if we conſider what belongs to working, and the uſefulneſs of their labour) one is worth two or three other Perſons taken in general out of the Maſs of Mankind. At that time there might be near upon the like number of Men as of Women, whereas now there is great reaſon to believe there are at leaſt two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to one Man. Now if we value them according to their Work, and to the Profit which they may bring thereby to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60783:10"/> as muſt be done, and as always is done by thoſe who buy Slaves, a Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eſtimated as much or more than two Women, <hi>caeteris paribus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome may imagine that I aggravate the matter, when I ſay, there is not in value the half of the People which was in <hi>France</hi> 30 years ago, and that half of the Men is periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I would beſeech thoſe who make that objection, to inform themſelves from ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible perſons as have come from <hi>France</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this 12 Months, and they will tell them that there are no Men almoſt to be ſeen in little Towns and Boroughs, but only Women; that moſt of the Houſes are uninhabited, and the greateſt part of the Lands and Vines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated for want of Men; and 'tis known, that for the ſame reaſon the ordinary Taxes yield leſs by half to the King, than they did formerly, tho' Taxes be much greater in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Extream Miſery of the People, than they were 30 years ago, when every body was richer. For that very Reaſon, 'tis that the Poll-Tax has fallen ſo much below the King's expectation. And in truth, when we revolve in our thoughts the <hi>French</hi> King's conduct for theſe 30 years laſt paſt, we cannot call in Queſtion his Kingdom's being depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated one half at leaſt; when we conſider that of a long time it has been engaged in War, which hath deſtroyed a great multitude of the Subjects. No body is ignorant, how that in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60783:11"/> time of Peace he kept 200 Thouſand Men in Arms, without including the Servants of Officers; and they were all unmarried Men for the moſt part, who conſequently could not People the Land, but were rather very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to the induſtrious part of the People, and by that means obſtructed propagation; 'tis known, that when he did not think it time to declare War againſt any of his Neighbours, he did lend his Forces to other Princes and Nations that were in War, as he did to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and to the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> to the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp;c. Every body knows, that there went out of the Kingdom from time to time, or rather continually, for 30 years paſt, an incredible number of Subjects into the Conquered Provinces and Towns to ſeek for a Refuge there, againſt the Vexations they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in their Native Country in hopes to be leſs tormented with Impoſitions, and to live more at quiet: There they got their livelyhood more eaſily, and took Wives; The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Provinces and Towns did encourage them in their new Settlements, and imployed them preferably to the Natives of theſe places, about all forts of Work, both for the King and themſelves, as thinking they would be uſeful to keep the conquered People in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. What prodigious multitudes beſides was there in the Kingdom of thoſe called <hi>Gabeleurs,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60783:11"/> (that is, Tax-men &amp; Collectors, the Inſtruments and Tools of the inſatiable avarice of the general &amp; particular Farmers of the Impoſts) who were Unmarried for the moſt part, and did beſides devour the poor people; all which are things very hurtful to Propagation; without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the multitudes of Officers of all kinds, as well of Judicature as others, whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are ſo much increaſed theſe 30 years laſt, and who did all ſwallow up the Subſtance of the People, and conſequently were fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to depopulate the Country-Moreover, what prodigious quantity of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hath not the King maintained in the Armies, theſe 8 years laſt? I believe every Body will agree, that reckoning Infantry, Cavalry, Dragoons, Artillery, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, Ammunition, Proviſions, Militia, Fleets and Gallies, which he kept at Sea ever ſince the War, except the laſt year, there could not be leſs than 400 thouſand Men in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without including Officers Servants. It has been obſerved by the Liſts of Recruits, that every year, one with another, a third part of thoſe Men was miſſing, eſpecially of the regular Land Forces, and if we count only the fourth part, it will come to 100 thouſand Men every year, and during the 8 years of War, to 800 thouſand, without mentioning thoſe that remain and compoſe the Armies, which inſtead of being uſeful to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to what concerns Husbandry, Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60783:12"/> Trade and Arts, are very troubleſome to the other Subjects imployed in thoſe things, and make them to loſe a great part of their Time, by their Marches, Counter-marches, Lodgings and Sojournings. Not to mention their Robberies and Thefts, I grant that many of them are not Natives of <hi>France,</hi> but <hi>Switzers, Germans, Iriſh,</hi> and others, beſides thoſe compelled by force out of the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; and I ſuppoſe that thoſe Forreigners may make up the 8th part of the whole: But I have not counted amongſt the ſaid 400 thouſand the Servant-men in his Garriſons and Armies at Land and Sea, which amount no doubt, to 100 thouſand Men at leaſt; of which a great many die every year, tho' in leſſer numbers than the Soldiers, becauſe they are better maintained, and leſs expoſed to danger; and for the ſame reaſon fewer of 'em deſert. But however, great numbers of them periſh every year. 'Tis alſo obſervable, that very few of them Marry: So that the like number of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is thereby rendred uſeleſs for Propagation; for experience teaches us, and we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it by the Bills of Nativity, and Mortality in any City, that near upon as many Men as Women are born; which ſhews they are made one for the other. As for the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards which Church-men and others beget on thoſe poor Women, experience ſhews us alſo, that ſuch Children do commonly come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. In the mean time, the Men who ſtay
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60783:12"/> at home, die as faſt as uſually, and faſter too, by reaſon of the extream poverty under which they groan, ſo that they are not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves means of recovery when they fall ſick; and their place is not filled up, as it uſed to be, by Young Men, becauſe moſt of them periſh in the War, and ſo the courſe of ordinary Propagation is interrupted; To which muſt be added, that as to the ſmall number of Batchelors or Widowers remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who might Marry, there is perhaps not one among twenty who does it, ſince this War, by reaſon of the intolerable Taxes, from which no condition of Men is free, but fall much heavier upon the Married People, who are ſettled, than upon the Unmarried. And even amongſt thoſe that have ſome Eſtate, very few marry; becauſe, during the War, all things are uncertain, and in confuſion; Every one is ignorant of the ſtate of other Mens Affairs, nor know they what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them at laſt, and becauſe ſuch, who ſeem to have ſomething of their own at preſent, has perhaps in reality nothing, or will be reduced to that condition in a little time, becauſe VVar and Taxes devour and conſume all, without diſtinction. Theſe 10 or 12 years laſt, very few Marriages have been made in <hi>France,</hi> but eſpecially ſince the War: So that the Kingdom muſt needs in a little time ſuffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely by that Interruption of Propagation for ſo many years; for it fares with a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60783:13"/> in this reſpect as with an Orchard of Trees; where, unleſs you take care to plant and graft every year new Trees in the Room of thoſe which Age or blaſting Winds ſnatch away, after a certain time there will be none remaining.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, for beſides the want of Marriage, the accidents of War, and other diſorders which I have ſpoken of, there is an incredible number of Men, Women and Children, who for a long time have periſht thro' extream poverty and miſery, tho' fewer Men than Women, becauſe their number is leſs, and fewer Children do alſo periſh for that ſame Reaſon. Whereupon it is proper to take notice of Sir <hi>William Petty</hi>'s Obſervation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Mr. <hi>Azout,</hi> a famous Mathematitian belonging to the <hi>French</hi> King; which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the Hoſpitals of <hi>Paris</hi> alone, there dyed yearly, only for want of good treatment, above 3500 Souls, more than did proportionably in the <hi>London Hoſpitals,</hi> and that the worſt Hoſpital of this City, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the beſt of <hi>Paris;</hi> I ſhall add to what this ingenious Man ſaid, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the inhumanity of thoſe Hoſpitals in <hi>France,</hi> the Poverty of the Common-people in <hi>Paris</hi> is ſo great, that thoſe poor People find themſelves obliged upon the leaſt indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go into the Grand Hoſpital of that City, which they call, <hi>Hotel-dieu,</hi> that is to ſay, God's Houſe, but deſerves better to be called
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60783:13"/> 
                  <hi>The Devils Houſe,</hi> than that murdering Hold in the Caſtle of <hi>Namur</hi> which did bear that Name, there they lye four and four in every Bed, two at the Head and two at the Feet; and moſt times a poor ſick perſon, whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is his greateſt Diſeaſe, and who would preſently recover if he could have good Food, is laid in the ſame bed with another who is at the point of Death, or has an infectious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and ſometimes with a dead Carcaſs that is carried away two hours after to the Grave; So that 'tis no wonder, if they ſoon periſh when treated in that barbarous manner; That kind of death was formerly invented and practiſed by certain Ancient Tyrants as a cruel puniſhment to Criminals, cauſing them to be tyed to a dead and ſtinking Carcaſs, that they might feel themſelves rot by degrees together with the Carrion. 'Tis a piece of cruelty that deſerves the curſe both of God and Man; and 'tis ſurprizing that no body, that I know of, hath hitherto had ſo much charity and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity as to make complaint to the World of that horrid abuſe; but on the contrary, they are ſo far from complaining againſt it, that there is hardly one year, but many Eſtates and Sums are bequeathed by dying perſons to that Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and they uſe alſo in the Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to adjudge part of the Fines to which people are condemned for the maintenance thereof. The Directors of that Hoſpital en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy vaſt Revenues belonging to that Houſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60783:14"/> which are more than ſufficient to maintain all the ſick who are brought into it very well; nay, a much greater number, and likewiſe to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Bed for every one of them. If it be ſaid, that the place is too narrow, I anſwer, it were eaſie to build a larger; they have Stock enough for that, or, at leaſt, they had formerly; for, I muſt confeſs, that I am of opinion that their Revenues are very much ſunk ſince the VVar, as well as the Revenues of others, and even of the Clergy themſelves; yet it had been eaſie for them to hire as many Houſes in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, as they ſhould have needed. The obſervation of that ingenuous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight, and likewiſe what I have made bold to add to it, being true, as indeed it cannot be doubted, if the proofs that he hath brought for it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we may reaſonably conclude, that there muſt die in the reſt of <hi>Paris</hi> at that time a far greater number than in the <hi>Hotel-dieu,</hi> for it is known, that no ſick body can come into that abominable place, without great recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, ſuch is the multitude of thoſe who are brought thither; ſo that there is reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to believe, that there died for want of neceſſaries, thro' meer poverty, at leaſt as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the reſt of the City, as there did in that Hoſpital. This cannot be queſtioned, if we conſider the miſery of the other poor people at <hi>Paris,</hi> which are numerous there, as well as in the other places of the Kingdom; 'Tis 13 or 14 years ago, ſince a Church-man of Quality
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60783:14"/> and one of the honeſteſt Men of that kind, in <hi>France,</hi> who had ſome ſhare in the Direction of the Alms beſtowed upon the poor of that City, did aſſure a Perſon of honour, that an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenumber of the Inhabitants of <hi>Paris</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Alms, and that in one Pariſh only, which he named to him, there were more thouſands of Alms People than I am willing to name. This is known alſo, that the poor at <hi>Paris</hi> are very much ſtraitned in their Lodgings, moſt of them live in the tops of Houſes, in the fifth or ſixth Story, which kills multitudes of them by climbing ſo high: And when they are kept a Bed by ſickneſs, they muſt needs periſh for want of help; ſo that it was no wonder at all, if the Bills of Mortality at <hi>Paris,</hi> when publiſhed (which they are not at preſent) did approach ſo near thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> as to the number of Dead, tho' there was much leſs people at <hi>Paris,</hi> than at <hi>London.</hi> And altho' the number of the pcople of <hi>Paris</hi> muſt needs be diminiſhed, a third part at leaſt, ſince Sir <hi>William Petty</hi>'s Obſervation, yet I will make bold to affirm, that there dies more people there at preſent than formerly, becauſe of their want of help, their Poverty being increaſed very much ſince that time; But ſuppoſe there ſhould not have died at that time and ſince, for want of neceſſaries, above 7 thouſand at <hi>Paris</hi> yearly, comprehending therein the 3500 who died in the Hoſpitals, by their barbarous treatment aforeſaid; what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60783:15"/> ought we to judge of the reſt of the Kingdom, when conſidering that <hi>Paris</hi> is the Center of its riches, and conſequently a place where the poor ought to be beſt helped! The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Paris</hi> at that time, that is, 15 or 16 years ago, did not make above the 27th or 28th part of the People of the Kingdom; So that if as many proportionably had dyed for want of help in the Country, as at <hi>Paris,</hi> which I do not think there did, to what a prodigious number would that have amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? beſides thoſe who uſe to dye by Age, and Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Then if things were ſo at that time, the Reader may eaſily gueſs how it may be at this day: And moreover, 'tis known that the 5th or 6th part of the Nation was ſnatcht away by Famine and Mortality two years ago</p>
               <p>I do not mention the Perſecution, which deſtroyed abundance of people by Hunger, Cold, and Nakedneſs; beſides what fell by the hand of the Hangman, or the Sword. Thoſe that were baniſhed out of the Kingdom, were indeed a great number of Subjects: Yet I confeſs they are more conſiderable by the Wealth they carried out of the Nation, than by their numbers, tho' not inconſiderable nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that reſpect, ſince they amounted, as I judge, to about 150 thouſand Souls.</p>
               <p>So that above one half of the Men have periſhed within theſe 30 years, and at leaſt one third part of the whole people; So that it is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60783:15"/> much, if of the 13 Millions and a half, which were ſuppoſed to have been in <hi>France</hi> about thirty years ago, there be 9 Millions remaining, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which we can ſcarcely ſuppoſe there are two Millions of Men.</p>
               <p>If we come next to conſider the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men unſit for work among thoſe 2 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, which is almoſt as great now as when the Men were twice as many, <hi>viz</hi> Thoſe who either by their Eſtates, Dignity or Profeſſion, or by bodily Infirmity are diſpenſed from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may eaſily be convinced, that thoſe who are in the Armies at Land and Sea, and in Garriſons, being moſt in the prime of their Age, and able to work, ſhould do more work, if employed about Husbandry, Arts and Trade, than all the reſt of the Men in the Kingdom. So that we ſee only by this Article of the People, which includes all the Riches and Strength of a Nation, how impoſſible 'tis for that Kingdom, which is half depopulated, to recover it ſelf in a long time, according to the Obſervation of Naturaliſts, and of thoſe who have ſtudied the Progreſs of Nativity and Mortality in Nations; for they have obſerved, that no leſs than 200 years is requiſite for doubling the number of Inhabitants in them, allowing what is to be allowed for Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſeaſes, Famines and War, which uſed to ſnatch away now and then great multitudes. So that theſe things being conſidered, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> ſhould require 200 years to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60783:16"/> recover it ſelf to what it was thirty years ago.</p>
               <p>We flatter our ſelves, for want of pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering things, that a Peace for 10 or 12 years would reſtore all things to their former ſtate. But how can a Nation, deſtroyed to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as <hi>France</hi> is, by Abſolute Power, retrieve it ſelf under the ſame Abſolute Power, in ſo little a time? I dare be bold to ſay, That not only 200 years, but even 2000 could not do it. The fire may as ſoon reſtore things conſumed by fire, as Deſpotical Government reſtore <hi>France</hi> to its former State. So that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>France</hi> muſt needs be changed, or elſe it is impoſſible that <hi>France</hi> ſhould ever be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to riſe again; and it ſeems every whit as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Monarchy ſhould ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a change. I remember that in the firſt year of the great War betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> under the general pretence of the <hi>Ill Satisfaction,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King received from the <hi>Dutch</hi> the Lands and Houſes which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready very much fallen of the former value, did decreaſe yet more all of a ſudden, which continued decreaſing to the end of the War. It was expected that after the Peace, they ſhould riſe again to the former value; But on the contrary, tho' the Nation was very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, yet the Taxes grew more and more with the Princes Vanity, one Oppreſſion did follow upon the back of another; ſo that we ſaw nothing but oppoſition; the value of all Eſtates did decreaſe more and more. But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60783:16"/> what was that War in compariſon of this? Trade, Husbandry, Manufactures, and Arts which are now ruin'd, did flouriſh then. We had plenty of Money, Men, and Horſes at that time, and our Taxes and Impoſitions, tho' exceſſive, had not ſuch a Diſproportion to the Ability of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as thoſe exacted at this day.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe <hi>gratis</hi> that the King ſhould repent of all the Evil he has done, and his Government ſhould become Milder, or that the <hi>Dolphin</hi> were to Succeed him in a little time; will this bring to life again ſo many Millions of People deſtroyed? Will it repair the dreadful Effects of the want of Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during ſuch a long time, of which want, Poſterity will be more ſenſible than thoſe who live at preſent, becauſe all thoſe Children which have failed as to the preſent Generation, would be but young, and as yet unfit for work; whereas 20 years hence they would be Adult Men and Women. Where ſhall we have all the People that are neceſſary to inhabit ſuch a great number of Towns, Borroughs, Villages, and Houſes, Diſpeopled, Abandoned, and falling to Decay? Who ſhall Cultivate ſo many Vineyards and forſaken Lands over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with Shrubs and Weeds? Moreover, the three parts of the Coin of the Nation hath been diſſipated. Wind and Water-mills, Cauſeys and Banks of Rivers are for the moſt part over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, or demoliſht; the High-ways, and even Streets in Cities and Towns are unpaſſable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60783:17"/> in moſt Places, the Bridges fallen down, and publick Buildings, and Hoſpitals deſolate; and the King having poſſeſſed himſelf of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of thoſe Hoſpitals that are in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; what will become of the Sale of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Places? or rather, of what uſe will they be? and if that cuſtom be laid aſide as it ſeems but reaſonable it ſhould: The Officers, part of whoſe Eſtates conſiſt in that Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, ought at leaſt to be reimburſed in part of the Sum which they laid out to buy them, and ſo the People muſt be vexed by the raiſing of thoſe Sums for a great many years. It was judged before the War, that the Stock of all the Offices of the Kingdom did amount to above 1200 millions of Livers, and it has increaſed ſince at leaſt 200 Millions; I mean the Offices of Judicature, Finances and Civil Government, and all others, whether they depend upon any of thoſe three Orders, or otherwiſe. I believe indeed, that moſt of thoſe who bought them, would willingly ſell them again, if they could, for the 4th or 5th part of what they gave for them, becauſe the ſaid Offices bring them very little proſit, and that they judge they will bring them leſs hereafter; beſides that, they ſerve for a pretence to the King to demand ever and anon conſiderable Sums of Money from the Poſſeſſors under the different names of Taxes, Loans, Increaſe of Wages, or Additions of new Rights and Prerogatives to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that they are in poſſeſſion of, and ſuch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60783:17"/> like; But if ſo be the King had a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe them the 4th or 5th part of what they laid out in the purchaſe of them, where ſhould thoſe 3 or 400 Millions be found? eſpecially if we conſider that the King Owes vaſt Sums to his Subjects, that have been borrowed upon his own account, which, 'tis like, will never be paid them again? On the other ſide, if the Sale of Places and Offices continues to have its courſe, and if ſo be the Places remain in as great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as they are at this day, or were before the War, there will be no proportion between that huge multitude of Offices, and ſmall number of Subjects, much leſs between ſuch a number of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and the Peoples Wealth or Abilities, which will be diminiſhed not only one half, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three 4ths, taking all the Kingdom in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. So many Offices would be an intolerable Oppreſſion to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo ruined; and it would be altogether impoſſible that thoſe Officers could ſubſiſt in ſuch great numbers, no not even the half of them. Every body knows, that as the King ſold their Places very dear, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves authorized to improve them as much as they can, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> and though they had gotten no more but the Intereſt of their Money every year, at twenty years purchaſe, it would have amounted to 7 Millions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But I think we may boldly affirm, that they doubled it at leaſt, for thoſe Gentlemen for the moſt part did not give away their pains
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60783:18"/> and time for nothing The Author of the laſt Will of Mr. <hi>Colbert,</hi> whether he be the late Deceaſed <hi>Colbert,</hi> or any other Ingenious Man, aſſures us, that the Officers of Judicature alone did get from the People's Subſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 200 Millions yearly. I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he aggravates the Matter or no, but be how it will. one may ſee by this, that I am moderate, when I reckon only 140 Millions of Livers, for what the ſame Officers with thoſe of the <hi>Finances</hi> and <hi>Civil Government,</hi> did raiſe together from the People. I do nor here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Sallaries which the King is bound to give them for the Executing thoſe Offices, for beſides that they are inconſiderable, and but ill paid too; they are obliged in order to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſame to their Familys, to pay to the King the <hi>Annual Right,</hi> as they call it, every year, which is very near as much as the Sallery promiſed them; and which is alſo very pleaſant, the King oft-times will not diſcount for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries he owes them, ſo that they are forced to pay the <hi>Annual Right</hi> exactly, or loſe their Places.</p>
               <p>But after all this, what ſhall we do with that numerous Army of Exactors, Tax-men, Collectors, and other miſchievous Tools be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the general and particular Farmers of the Impoſts; which, as I ſaid already, were reckoned formerly to be about 100 thouſand in number, thro' all the Kingdom, but are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed very much ſince this War, by reaſon of the People's Diminution and Poverty; ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60783:18"/> that they cannot now bear the charges of Maintaining ſo great a number of them. That ſort of People formerly coſt as much as all the Armies both by Land and Sea, tho' the King did not give a Farthing of his own for their Maintenance; for his Revenues were brought into his Coffers free, and without any coſts, to the Sum of above 132 Millions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yearly, beſides the extraordinary Impoſts which he did raiſe now and then, according to his fancy, as well in time of Peace as of War. I confeſs thoſe Caterpillars are not ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous at preſent, and I believe they may be decreaſed one half in number, but however, they are ſtill very chargeable to the People. VVho then can imagine that the Kingdom will be able after the Peace to bear ſuch a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe? I do not mention the other Miſchiefs of all kinds, which thoſe Collectors did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate, as Frauds, Extorſions, Unjuſtices, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences and Rapines, which they did commit then, and no doubt do ſtill upon People of all Ranks and Conditions, being ſupported and authorized therein by the Miniſters of State, and by the Intendants, even in thoſe Caſes where the King's Service was not concerned. Does any Man believe that the King will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the diminiſhing of his Houſhold and Armies by Land and Sea, in proportion to the decreaſe of his People and their riches? I do indeed think that he will be obliged to do it, againſt his VVill, but not to ſuch a degree
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60783:19"/> as may be neceſſary. VVho will oblige him to be contented with 20 or 30 Millions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yearly, and with 30 or 40 thouſand Men in his Garriſons, which would be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to the end the people might breath a little? VVho ſhall perſuade him to abandon all his Conqueſts, which are fit only to depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate his Kingdom, and cannot fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle the fire of VVar again very ſuddenly?</p>
               <p>But all that I have ſaid hitherto of the Miſchiefs which I fore-ſee will befal the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com after a Peace, is nothing in compariſon of the Cruel VVar, which Creditors will declare againſt their Debtors; for 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that on the footing whereon all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Kingdom now ſtand, that is to ſay, the 82 Millions of Acres which are in it; 'tis probable, I ſay, that the Lands, Houſes, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Eſtates and Offices, will not be ſufficient to pay all the Debts contracted upon them, or with which they are charged; So that 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, that, after the Peace, be it made how it will, but that an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people will be ſtript of all they have. For all the Stocks in the Kingdom, taken in general, will not be worth the 4th part, nor perhaps the 8th or the 10th of what they were 30 years ago. So that Debtors or Creditors, muſt needs be ruined, or at leaſt they muſt loſe the greateſt part of their Eſtates; there is no <hi>medium</hi> for it, and that which is worſe, both the one and the other will be ruined at once:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60783:19"/> For if ſo be the Creditor is not paid, he will be reduced to Beggery, his Eſtate conſiſting in Debts, if paid, the Debtor muſt be ruined, and yet the Debt not perhaps fully paid. For example, a Debtor may have one Land-Eſtate, or more, which was worth a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns before the VVar, and upon this he hath contracted a Debt of 25 or 30 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, whereas his Land-Eſtate at preſent is worth but 20 thouſand Crowns, what then will become of him and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in caſe he pays his Debts, which amount to 30 thouſand Crowns? And in caſe he pays them not, what will become of his Creditor? Another example may be this; A Man who was formerly a wealthy Man, has lent, ſuppoſe 20 thouſand Crowns to one or ſeveral perſons, and at another time has borrowed of ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy 10 thouſand Crowns; if that Man has any means left him, his Creditors will oblige him to pay the 10 thouſand Crowns that he is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and if ſo be his Debtors are not ſolvent he is utterly ruined, for the reſt of his Eſtate, that might be worth formerly 40 or 50 thouſand Crowns, has been ſold for 10 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, which he gave to his Creditors, or perhaps for 5 thouſand: For, to ſay the truth, I do not think the real Eſtates can be ſold in <hi>France</hi> hereafter, for above the 10 part of what they were worth 30 years ago; 'Tis the ſame with Offices, which many have purchaſed with borrowed Money, and have mortaged their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60783:20"/> Offices to the Perſons who lent the Money, of which the value is alſo prodigiouſly fallen. In general, there were very few perſons, nay, even of the Richeſt, who had moſt owing them, but they were alſo owing ſomething to others. In particular, almoſt all the great ones of the Kingdom were drowned in Debts, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War, and a great number of others of all Conditions, had alſo obtained from the King, <hi>Letters of State,</hi> as they call them, in order to be diſcharged from paying their Debts, under colour, that they, or their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Children did ſerve the King; which Debts being not paid, neither Principal nor Intereſt, are every day multiplying <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> when at the ſame time their Land-Eſtates are deſtitute of Husbandmen and Cattle, and their Houſes falling to Ruine. I ask again, what muſt become of ſo many People, both Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Debtors, who will, by this means, be brought to deſpair? and beſides 'tis certain, that Lawyers, whoſe numbers are extreamly increaſed ſince this War, and who have been exhauſted by Taxes, and are thereby become greedy and famiſhed, will devour and ſwallow up both Creditors and Debtors, ſince they did ever ſo, even when they were in a proſperous condition.</p>
               <p>I further ask, what will become of the 4 or 500 thouſand Soldiers, who either never had any Eſtates, or have loſt them by the Common Fate of the Kingdom, and who are uſed to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60783:20"/> Violence and Rapine in a Nation ſo much deſolated and ſhattered, and where all things will ſtand in Confuſion? For the King will be forced, againſt his will, to diſmiſs at leaſt three parts of them. They will certainly become as many Rapparees, who will not fail of Trooping together in order to Pillage and Plunder Towns and Borroughs, or ſerve as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to the Princes of the Blood, and other Grandees of the Kingdom, and to all thoſe who may perhaps be diſcontented with the Elevation of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s the XIV. Baſtards, or their own Condition; and by this means kindle a Civil War in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>So that it appears evidently by what I have hitherto repreſented, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. is none of that ſort of Conquerours, who Inrich and People their Native Countries by their Conqueſts ſince he has waſted and ruined his Kingdom by the ſame. Other Soveraigns are wont in their neceſſary Wars to imploy but a very ſmall part of their Subjects, in compariſon of thoſe who remain at home, and to ſpend but a ſmall Portion of their Peoples Revenues, and not their Stock, eſpecially when acting of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively; but he on the contrary, maintains 4 or 500 thouſand Men in his Armies, while above half the Land in the Kingdom is Until<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for want of Men; and hath already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in this War the half of his People, and above three parts of the Subſtance of his Kingdom, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60783:21"/> Inſomuch that if all the Revenues of the Kingdom, as well as that which proceeds from Real and Perſonal Eſtates, as that which proceeds from Induſtry, were worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Millions of Livers yearly, as I conceive they were 30 years ago, they are not worth above 300, or at the utmoſt 400 Millions at preſent.</p>

               <head>CHAP II. A more Punctual and Particular Account of the preſent Condition of <hi>FRANCE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE come now to a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar &amp; larger Account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and paſt value of all Eſtates in <hi>France,</hi> and ſhall endeavour to diſcover, if poſſible, what difference there may probably be between their value 30 years ago, and their value at this day. I have ſaid already, that I did not think, that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of all Eſtates, Real and Perſonal, of the Kingdom, taken in general, did amount now in clear Money, Repairs being paid, to above the third part of what they did amount to 30 years ago, tho' there may be in ſome parts of the Kingdom, near the Frontiers, ſome Lands and Houſes, which may yield as much
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60783:21"/> or more Revenue now than they did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And I ground my Judgment upon this, that the one half of the Men are periſhed, or are employed in the War, and that the half of thoſe who are left are unprofitable for Husbandry, and all ſorts of Trade, ſo that ſtrictly ſpeaking, there is not remaining the third part of the Men ſit for work, which there were 30 years ago in the Kingdom; I ground what I ſay upon this, that the moſt part of the Lands are untilled, and Houſes forſaken, and even whole Towns, Borroughs, Villages and Pariſhes deſerted in many places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſo that Trade is interrupted both within and without the Nation; all the Manufactures are at a low Ebb; all Arts decayed, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is ſcarce; ſo that there is little conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Commodities; there is great want of Cattle, as well for number as for kind, Horſes fit for Husbandry, are extreamly dear and ſcarce; The Farmers are exhauſted by the enormous Taxes laid upon them, which at laſt falls heavy upon the Proprietor of the Land, and makes his Eſtate to be worth ſo much the leſs; there is alſo great ſcarcity of Farmers, and all ſorts of Labourers; they are extreme poor, and being ill maintained, they are the leſs able to work: The multitude of Beggars in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is incredible, and ſeveral amongſt them commit Robberies, and Steal away the Fruits of the Country, and whatever they can catch beſides, being unwilling to work, and live
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60783:22"/> always at the charges of the Country. The Kingdom is ſpoiled and ruined by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Countermarches, Quarterings, and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries of Soldiers, Troopers, Recruits, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, Ban and Rear-Ban. The Taxes laid upon all Proprietors of Lands and Houſes under ſeveral denominations, are exceſſive, and force them to ſell their Cattle, and Houſhold-Goods, and do diſable them from managing their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to the beſt advantage, and from helping and relieving their Farmers, and Peaſants, and bring them often to Deſpair.</p>
               <p>I do not queſtion but this Article may find Oppoſition, and that many will hardly believe the Eſtates in <hi>France</hi> to be ſo much fallen, but they areat liberty to Judge what they think fit: 'Tis true, very few of the Owners are ſincere enough to acknowledge the Degree of the Decay of their Eſtate, and they fancy 'tis a piece of Prudence not to do it, becauſe it would not help them in the leaſt, but rather tend to the ruine of their Credit; and that beſides there being almoſt no Lands lett for want of Farmers, they cannot well tell what Revenue they yield them at preſent, but every one gets out of them all that he can to live on, without being able to ſay what they are worth. Moſt Lands are now managed by Servant-Maids, and ſome old lame Servant-Men, who do the beſt they are able. Moreover, there are ſeveral Lands and Houſes Farmed, whoſe Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors being ruined by the War, and Taxes,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60783:22"/> and the ſmall price of Corn and Fruits, turn Bankrupt every day; I reckon that for loſt. And tho' there were a ſufficient number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fit to be Farmers, yet as they ſee no proſpect of an end to this War, and that the Kings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries are always upon the catch to take hold of all Money, where-ever they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, they dare not take any thing in hand at this hard time, but chuſe rather to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as worth nothing at all.</p>
               <p>And further, tho' the Eſtates had not been realy Decayed ſo much as to the Revenue, yet they muſt have Diminiſhed as much in the real value; and that ſo much the more, that the great number of Women, who Cultivate at preſent much Land, and the ſmall number of Men remaining, Decreaſes every day by death, without any hopes that their numbers ſhould be filled up again by Generation, for want of Marriages; So that there will be a great want of People in that reſpect, ſome years hence; And altho' the Peace were made to day, <hi>France</hi> muſt continually Decreaſe in its num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of People, till there be an equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the number of Men and Women, and that by an Univerſal Change of the ſeverity of the Government, they may be induced to marry, as formerly they did, and ſo Re-people the Kingdom by degrees.</p>
               <p>So that I muſt be of Opinion, oppoſe it who will, that all the Lands and Perſonal-Eſtates in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> do not at this day, yield
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60783:23"/> in Revenues or Annual Profit, above the third part of what they did formerly, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts, it may be, to 130 Millions of Livers, or there abouts, whereas they might bring in 30 years ago, about 400 Millions of Livers. I am confirmed in this opinion by the Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Revenue of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates in <hi>England,</hi> which I find to be 16 Millions Sterling <hi>per annum,</hi> or 200 and eight Millions of Livers, to which Eſtimation I adhere, tho' I am of opinion that at preſent the Revenue of the ſaid Eſtates may amount to above 18 Millions Sterling, becauſe the product is worth more now, than 'twas before the War, that diverſe improvements have been made for theſe ſeveral years paſt, and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit of Perſonal Eſtates increaſe likewiſe daily. Let us come now to the particulars of this Compariſon.</p>
               <p>There be, as I ſaid, in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> 82 Millions of Acres, and in <hi>England</hi> about 30, at the ſame meaſure, that is to ſay, there is almoſt 3 times as much Ground in <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> ſince <hi>England</hi> is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>France,</hi> but as 4 to 11.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe 82 Millions of Acres, which are in <hi>France,</hi> about 16 Millions muſt be deducted, as alſo about 6 Millions of the 30 in <hi>England,</hi> which in both Kingdoms conſiſt in Lands, that may be called unprofitable, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce little or nothing, as Rivers, Heaths, High-Ways, Rocks, Sands, Downs, Banks
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60783:23"/> of the Sea, Rivers, Moraſſes, and other ſuch Barren Grounds.</p>
               <p>Thoſe 24 Millions of Acres are valued in <hi>England</hi> at 8 Millions Sterling, of yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, that is to ſay, at 6 <hi>s.</hi> and 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Acre, one with another, by adding thereto the Lands, called <hi>Unprofitable,</hi> tho' they are not abſolutely ſo.</p>
               <p>I ſay, that 'tis not likely the Lands in <hi>France</hi> ſhould have ever been worth ſo much, even when they were moſt valuable, as in <hi>England</hi> from the time that both Kingdoms were Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and have driven any Sea-Trade in <hi>Europe;</hi> becauſe Lands in <hi>France</hi> are generally more remote from the Sea than they are in <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently their Foreign-Trade, and the exportation of their product is leſs, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government is alſo Milder than that of <hi>France,</hi> and that the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the improvement of Lands, and the welfare of a Nation, as I ſhall demonſtrate in its proper place. Beſides, the Soil in <hi>France</hi> is generally leſs fruitful than in <hi>England,</hi> nor is it ſo plentiful in Paſtures, which are the beſt of all Land-Eſtates. There be in <hi>France</hi> few Coal-Pits, no Tin, Copper, or Lead-Mines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are many in <hi>England,</hi> without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning that <hi>England</hi> has been always more populous than <hi>France,</hi> as I ſhall juſtifie it, and as follows naturally from the Reaſons which I have produced already, beſides a great many others which ſhall find room in a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60783:24"/>
               <p>For thoſe Reaſons the Land-Eſtates muſt needs have always been more valuable gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>France;</hi> and I verily believe they never exceeded in <hi>France,</hi> even in the time of their greateſt Proſperity, the value of 16 Millions Sterling, of yearly Revenue. Had they been worth as much proportionably as thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> where 30 Millions of Acres are valued, as I have ſaid, at 8 Millions Sterling, of yearly Revenue, then the 82 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Acres in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould have been worth 22 Millions Sterling, of yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
               <p>According to that Eſtimation, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of all the Lands in <hi>France</hi> can never have exceeded, even in the beſt times, 16 Millions Sterling, or 208 Millions of Livers; and I am willing to ſuppoſe they might amount to that Sum 30 years ago, tho' I can hardly believe it. But becauſe for many years, the Revenue of Lands hath been Decreaſing, and eſpecially ſince this War, I ſuppoſe it is not worth now above the third part of what it was worth 30 years ago, and dare ſay, that the ſaid 82 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Acres are not worth at preſent above 5 Millions and a half Sterling, or 72 Millions of Livers yearly, that is to ſay, about 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per Acre,</hi> one with another.</p>
               <p>No body ought to be ſurprized at this Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſeeing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where Land is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally better than in <hi>France,</hi> and nearer the Sea, where there is a free Trade, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60783:24"/> which is almoſt as populous proportionably, as <hi>France</hi> is at this day, ſince 'tis probable there is not above the third part more People in <hi>France,</hi> proportionably to its bigneſs, than there are in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſay, the Acre of Land is not valued, one with another, a Shilling <hi>per Annum,</hi> although it abounds with Paſture Grounds, which are the moſt profitable of any, and the moſt eaſie to be managed.</p>
               <p>We ought to make the ſame Judgment of the Revenue of Houſes in <hi>France</hi> proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is alſo fallen two thirds, and that ſo much the more, becauſe, tho they be Uninhabited or fallen in their Rent, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs are the ſame, or greater than formerly; but let us grant, that their value holds the ſame proportion with the Houſes in <hi>England,</hi> as do the Lands of both Kingdoms reſpectively.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not value them in particular here, but ſhall joyn them to the Perſonal-Eſtates, in conjunction with which they are Judged to be worth 8 Millions Sterling of Revenue, or Annual Profit, in <hi>England,</hi> that is to ſay, as much as the Lands. They do not think for all they value them ſo, that the Perſonal-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates with the Houſes, are equal in worth to the value of Lands, as to the price of the Principal, but they do value their Profits at that rate, becauſe the Intereſt of Perſonal-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates is greater, than that of the real. In that manner, by keeping the ſame proportion which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60783:25"/> we did in reſpect of the Lands of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; I ſay, holding the ſame proportion between the Houſes and Perſonal-Eſtates in <hi>France,</hi> and the Houſes and Perſonal-Eſtates in <hi>England,</hi> theſe ought to be valued in <hi>France,</hi> at 5 Millions and a half, as well as Lands.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be confeſſed, that tho' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of Houſes ſhould have decayed more than thoſe of Lands; yet the Revenues of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal-Eſtates ought to be more diminiſhed; and withal, that this ſort of Goods was never worth near ſo much in <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> which hath ever had, in that reſpect, a greater advantage over <hi>France,</hi> than it had in reſpect of the value of Lands.</p>
               <p>So that I give a great allowance to <hi>France,</hi> when I value the Revenue of their Houſes and Perſonal-Eſtates, at 4 Millions and an half Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And indeed Perſonal-Eſtates, conſiſting in Cattle of all kinds, in Furniture of Houſes, Silver Coined, and not Coined, Jewels, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any Man may eaſily ſee, in running over all thoſe Species, that they are much leſs than formerly, and that the Profits of them are alſo by conſequence, much leſs.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> Cattle are much diminiſhed; there is none left in moſt places, they having been ſold to pay Taxes, or Debts, and the Farms have been abandoned afterwards, and where there is any Cattle, there is far from being enough, and what they have is poor,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60783:25"/> weak, ill-fed, and ill-taken care of, for want of Servants; and they are worth but little Money, becauſe of the want of Eaters, and the want of Money too; There are very few Horſes left, the War having deſtroyed almoſt all of 'em, and the People being not able to bring them up, by Reaſon of their Poverty. 'Tis true, they are ſold dear, but that is an aggravation of the People's Miſery, ſeeing 'tis their Scarcity which is the cauſe of it, and that they cannot be wanted neither, and yet the people are not able to buy them; For this Reaſon ſeveral Lands are left Untilled, <hi>viz.</hi> In all the Plain Provinces, where they want Hay for Oxen, and muſt needs make uſe of Horſes, or Mules, who feed moſt upon Straw, and Oats. As to other Perſonal-Goods, it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that 'tis yet worſe: As for example, As to Furniture of Houſes and Houſhould-Goods, no body is now curious in them, &amp; what is worſe, very few buy any New ones; becauſe there is ſuch a quantity of Old, that they may be had almoſt for nothing: As for Money, every body knows there is little in the Kingdom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it brings no profit to them, who keep it, eſpecially there being no Trade, and if it be lent to the King, or diſcovered by him any way, then 'tis loſt.</p>
               <p>There is but little Plate and Jewels left in the Kingdom, for none but Great Perſons, ſuch as Lords and Ladies, have any; As or Mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Commodities there are very few Made or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60783:26"/> Sold at preſent. The Store-houſes are all empty; Manufactures, Trade and Arts are all decayed, and by Conſequence the Ships bring no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to their Owners neither; ſo that 'tis eaſie to conceive, that the Revenue of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal-Eſtates is yet more fallen than that of Lands; the Tillage and Product of which can much worſe be ſpared, than any thing elſe. So that all the Revenue of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> both Real and Perſonal, is not now worth above 10 Millions Sterling, or 130 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers, whereas it was probably worth near 30 Millions Sterling, or 400 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers, 30 years ago and ſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of all Real and Perſonal-Eſtates of <hi>France,</hi> muſt be worth leſs at preſent, by 6 Millions Sterling, or 72 Millions of Livers, than the Revenues of the ſame Eſtates in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved by the way, that the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> poſſeſſes the half of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in the Kingdom, that is to ſay, about 15 Millions Sterling, or 200 Millions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, of Revenue formerly, and at preſent about the third part of that Sum, or 65 Millions of Livers.</p>
               <p>I do not queſtion but many People will be ſurprized at this Computation, whom I will endeavour to ſatisfie, but I deſire leave, Firſt, To anſwer ſome Objections, which may be made to ſome Points.</p>
               <p>As for example; Some may ask how I make it out that Houſhold-Goods, Silver Uncoined,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60783:26"/> Jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produce any Revenue or Profit; I anſwer, That the uſe which is made of them is accounted for as much Revenue, becauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bring ſome Advantage, or elſe are an Ornament to thoſe who make uſe of them, as a ſtately Houſe is inſtead of a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to the Proprietor, tho' he inhabits it himſelf, becauſe, if he did lett it out to any other Perſons, he would get a great Rent for it, and if he did ſell it, it would yield him a great Sum of Money, which, laid out at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or in Trade, would afford him great Profit It is the ſame with the things in queſtion, and with Merchandize, which are Judged to bring a good Revenue in the Store-Houſes and in the Shop, becauſe, when the time of Sale comes, the Owner has a greater Profit by them, than if he had lett out his Money at Ordinary Intereſt. If any Man ask further, why I have diſtinguiſhed the Revenue of Lands from that of Houſes, and wattle, ſince Lands are not worth any thing without Houſes and Cattle, it being impoſſible to cultivate them without thoſe things? I anſwer as to the firſt, that I include with the Lands, the Houſes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Habitation of thoſe who man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age them, and for the harbouring of their Cattle; which cannot be lett a part, it being known that the Houſes of Husband-men, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Gentlemen in the Country, make part of the Farms, and belong to them.</p>
               <p>The Houſes, or the Revenue of Houſes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60783:27"/> which I diſtinguiſhed from thoſe belonging to Lands, are the Houſes of Cities, Towns and Borroughs, and generally all thoſe which are lett out without Lands.</p>
               <p>I diſtinguiſh alſo the Revenue of Lands from that of Cattle, becauſe we ſee every day Lands lett to Farm, without Cattle, the Farmers themſelves furniſh Cattle, and pay ſo much the leſs to the Proprietor: For if ſo be the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer would not, or could not do it, it would be the Proprietor's part to do it, in which caſe the Farmer muſt give more for the Land and Cattle together, than they would have done for the Land alone. Certainly there are very few Perſons who do not know this.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Subject, I ſaid, that many will be ſurprized to ſee that we value the Revenues of <hi>France</hi> ſo little, and that we prefer the preſent Revenues of <hi>England</hi> to them, tho' it be not much above the third part of <hi>France</hi> in extent; nay, and according to ſome, it is leſs than the third part of <hi>France,</hi> and does not exceed the Province of <hi>Languedock</hi> in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions.</p>
               <p>They will be amazed likewiſe to find that I value the Acre of Land at 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> one with another, or about 22 <hi>French</hi> Sols, becauſe they know ſome Lands elſewhere, that were worth 10, 20, or 30 times more. Others may object other things, or ſay, That I have a mind to flatter the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; but I proteſt, I ſpeak according to my own Conſcience; every
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60783:27"/> body knows, I have little Reaſon either to admire my Lot in <hi>England,</hi> or to flatter the Nation. But I anſwer further, That every one is free to think what he pleaſes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it; I do not pretend that all that I Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is Mathematical Demonſtrations, but only Probabilities extraordinary well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I dare ſay, That if they had exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned things as narrowly as I have done, and had exerciſed themſelves as much as I have exerciſed my ſelf in that kind of Study, they would judge otherwiſe of the matter; but the truth is, few or none ſet their mind to thoſe things, or uſe to conſider them in this method, and we are naturally apt to oppoſe that which we do not underſtand, or which is againſt our prejudicate Opinions. So that I give leave to all ſuch who are of that Diſpoſition of Mind, to value the preſent Revenues of <hi>France</hi> as much, and the Revenues of <hi>England</hi> as little as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I ſay further, That it muſt be very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to diſown but that <hi>France</hi> is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Depopulated, and that abundance of Lands and Houſes have been forſaken, and that all the other Calamities which I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are confirmed to us every week by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters, and even by Perſons who come from thoſe Parts, ſhould be really true; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at this rate all things might be called in queſtion. I think there can be no Diſpute about the Deſolation of <hi>France,</hi> but only
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60783:28"/> about the Degree of it. But if it be certain, as I advance, that the 2 thirds parts of Men fit for work, or at leaſt the half, have periſhed in the War, or are dead for want of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, as it ſeems very unreaſonable to deny it; that alone will prove more than I deſire.</p>
               <p>As to the Bigneſs and Extent of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, I confeſs I have not meaſured them, but they have been meaſured by others, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them ſo much the rather, that I find upon the Maps, that it is very Rational, as well for the reſpective Quantity and Extent of both Kingdoms, as for the proportion which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be between them; and any Man, who hath but eyes, may meaſure upon the Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Maps, the Extent of both, and judge very near of the proportion of the one to the other.</p>
               <p>As for what concerns the Eſtimate of the Acres in <hi>France,</hi> which I value at 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> one with another at preſent, it is founded partly on the proportion which ought to be between the preſent and former value of the Eſtates in <hi>France,</hi> and partly upon the Common Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Acre of Land in <hi>England,</hi> which is of the ſame Meaſure with that in <hi>France,</hi> and by compariſon, I conclude from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above produced, which prove that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ought to have ever been Richer, and more Populous, and Fruitful than <hi>France,</hi> and from all thoſe which convince us that <hi>France</hi> is mightily Depopulated, and hath loſt the two
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60783:28"/> thirds of all her Men fit for work; I conclude, I ſay, from thence, that the Acres ought in general, to be near upon four times as much worth in <hi>England</hi> at preſent, as in <hi>France:</hi> It has been valued a long time ago at 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> the Acre one with another. I confeſs there may be many places in <hi>England</hi> where it is not worth 2 <hi>s.</hi> nor perhaps one; but there are ſome alſo, where it is valued at 30 and 40 times more. In general, 'tis moſt valuable in all Countries near good Sea-Ports, or Head-Cities, or Navigable-Rivers; And my Eſtimation muſt needs appear reaſonable to all thoſe who will be pleaſed to remember what I ſaid above, that the Acre in <hi>Ireland</hi> is not Farmed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, one with another, at above 10 <hi>d.</hi> or 11 <hi>d.</hi> tho' the Acre is bigger there, than in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> fruitfuller too, and nearer the Sea than <hi>France,</hi> and beſides that, injoyes liberty of Trade, and pays almoſt no Taxes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what <hi>France</hi> pays.</p>
               <p>But ſome may object again, and ask, How can your computation ſtand good as to the Revenues of <hi>France,</hi> ſince you ſaid, That the <hi>French</hi> King alone did raiſe every year, even in the time of Peace, above 132 Millions of Livers upon his People, beſides the Caſual or Extrordinary Taxes, which did amount of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to 30, 40, and 50 Millions of Livers more, and that the Officers of Judicature, and other Civil Officers, did get, one with another, every year at leaſt 140 or 150 Millions of Livers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60783:29"/> from the People; That the Farmers, general, and particular, and other Exactors of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions might coſt the Nation beſides 70 or 80 Millions more. And that over and above all this, the Church-men alone did poſſeſs near 200 Millions of yearly Revenue; without mentioning what they cheated the People of beſides, and got cunningly by their Subtilties, and driving a Trade, of what they call Holy Things, which I judge, did amount to above 30 Millions of Livers more every year.</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, I ſay, firſt, That as the King's Revenues, ſo likewiſe the Revenues and Gains of all thoſe ſorts of People, juſt now named, did Circulate amongſt all the Subjects, as is uſual for the Revenues and Profits of all thoſe who compoſe a Nation; and that as the King raiſed Sums upon the Officers of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, and other Civil Officers, as alſo upon the Clergy, and upon the Farmers, and Exactors of the Publick Impoſitions, by Ordinary and Extraordinary Taxes, and that they had ſo much the leſs clear Money by it, theſe People did alſo draw in to themſelves the Money of thoſe, amongſt whom the King, in the courſe of his ordinary Expences, diffuſed his Revenues; I ſay, they did draw it in according to their reſpective and uſual Ways and Methods, either by Suits at Law, Exactions, or Maſſes, or in ſome other way. It was the ſame Money which did Paſs and Repaſs by the Week, Quarter, or Half-Year, ſeveral times through
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60783:29"/> the Hands of all thoſe People; therefore it does not follow, that there were 5 or 600 Millions of Money in the Kingdom, tho' there was more in it than in moſt other Countries, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did all this Money proceed from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates; but chiefly from the Revenue and Profits of the induſtry of the Subjects.</p>
               <p>For as to the King's Revenues, 'tis known that a great part of the Impoſitions in <hi>France,</hi> are not laid on the Real Eſtates, but conſiſt in Exciſes upon all things generally which the People conſume, as well for Diet and Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as for other Uſes, and not upon the Real or Perſonal-Stocks only. The Revenues did conſiſt alſo in Cuſtoms or Taxes, upon all things Imported or Exported out of the Kingdom, Provinces, Cities and Towns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Subjects of the Kingdom, the Profit of the People's induſtry diffuſed it ſelf likewiſe amongſt all People, by the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Circulation.</p>
               <p>It muſt be known alſo that the Profits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in a diligent Nation, and indifferently populous, does amount almoſt to twice as much, as all the Revenues of Real and Perſonal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
               <p>I will make this Intelligible by a Familiar Example; We have often ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> and the ſame may be obſerved every where elſe, by conſidering Men; we have ſeen, I ſay, Lands Farmed at 3 or 400 Livers <hi>per Annum,</hi> pay as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60783:30"/> much to the King for the <hi>Taille</hi> and <hi>Impoſition</hi> on Salt, and yet maintain both the Farmer's Family and Servants. It was not the Money which the Proprietor received of his Farm, and which is properly the Revenue of the Land, that payed the ſaid Taxes, maintained all thoſe Perſons, and furniſhed them with all ſorts of Neceſſaries, but their Labour. Here follows another Example.</p>
               <p>They commonly value all the Corn ſpent in <hi>England</hi> at 10 Millions Sterling, one year with another, reckoning Wheat at 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Buſhel, and Barly at 2 <hi>s.</hi> and other Grains propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, and yet the Revenue of all the Lands is valued only at 8 Millions Sterling; and the Cattle, and all other things conſumed out of the Native Product are worth the double. Now if the Labour of them, who employ themſelves only about Husbandry, makes ſuch a product, how much more will the Labour of Mechanicks and Artiſts do it, and yet, the product of Manufactures and Mines is ſtill greater, but the profits of thoſe who are Employed by Sea, either in Fiſhing, Coaſting, or a Forreign Trade is the greateſt of all.</p>
               <p>In a Populous and Trading Country, the Revenue of Lands, Induſtry, and Profit ought to be greater than in other Places, for theſe things hold a ſympathy together; the one helps the other; for when Arts, Manufactures
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60783:30"/> and Trade thrive, the Revenue of Real and Perſonal-Eſtates increaſes, becauſe Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more Common and Currant; the Countrey grows more and more Populous, and more Proviſions, and other things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Mankind are ſpent: And likewiſe when Eſtates augment in Revenue, the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, Artiſts, Labourers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more Employed, and every one has more where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to Live, and the Country grows Richer and Richer.</p>
               <p>To make Application of this to my Subject, and to continue in the Compariſon I made of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, and of the Revenue of both the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> I will adventure to ſay, That the Profits of Induſtry ever ought to have been greater in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> by Reaſon of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which encourages Induſtry, and Trade more than <hi>Popery,</hi> which is deſtructive to them, as I ſhall ſhew; as alſo by Reaſon of the multitude of Mines, which we have mentioned already, the proximity of the Sea, the Forreign Trade, Fiſhery, of which the Profits are very great; and the Salary and Wages of thoſe imployed therein, being more conſiderable, and their number much greater in <hi>England,</hi> than in <hi>France.</hi> For in Countries more remote from the Sea, as <hi>France</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally compar'd with <hi>England,</hi> there are not ſo many Men of this ſort whoſe Labour and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60783:31"/> Time are ſo well rewarded, for generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thoſe who work about building of Ships and all other things belonging to Shipping, either for Men of War or Trading-Ships, earn three or four times as much as Common-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers do; It muſt be conſidered that there are above a hundred different Trades that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Sea, whoſe Workmen get proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Profits made by Navigation, Sea-Trade, or Fiſhing. There are in <hi>England</hi> four Men of that kind to one in <hi>France;</hi> tho' <hi>France</hi> is, as I have ſaid often, almoſt 3 times as big as <hi>England.</hi> This Article alone makes a great difference between the Profits of Induſtry in the two Kingdoms. For one cannot imagine the advantages which a Country near the Sea has over another that is far from it, if it were but for the Trade and carriage of heavy Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, which are a notable part of the Trade, and without which none can be managed at all; as are Timber and Wood, for Work or for Fire, and Minerals, Stones, Chalk, Sand, Glaſs, Bricks, Earthen Pots, wrought or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought Iron, Coals, Turfs, Butter, Cheeſe, Hemp, Flax, Wool, Salt, Wine, Beer, Syder, Corn, Tallow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Profit and Time of thoſe who are imployed about carrying ſuch things in a Country remote from Sea, comes almoſt to nothing, and yet the number of thoſe, who either tranſport and carry them, or Trade with 'em, is prodigious, in ſuch a large Country as <hi>France;</hi> whereas in <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60783:31"/> the Proximity of the Sea makes the Trade of all thoſe things to be very Profitable and Eaſie, and the conſumption of the ſame to be much greater, becauſe they are cheaper, which is an encouragement to Propagation; and then there are not ſo many imployed about carrying them proportionably as in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe of the facility of the carriage by Water, which cauſes thoſe imployed in them to get the more for their Labour and Time.</p>
               <p>As to Manufactures, tho' <hi>France</hi> had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>England,</hi> in regard of ſeveral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, yet I dare ſay, that that of Wool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in <hi>England</hi> did imploy more People pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, than did all thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> except that of Linnen-Weavers, which is a work very unprofitable; and beſides that, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Manfactures alſo practiſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's another thing that may alſo convince us, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People did in general get more <hi>Profit</hi> by their Induſtry, than the <hi>French</hi> proportionably; which is this, that in <hi>London,</hi> which is almoſt twice as Big and Populous as <hi>Paris,</hi> the Capital City of a Kingdom, 3 times as big, as I have ſaid often, than <hi>England</hi> is; in <hi>London,</hi> I ſay, Trades-men, and almoſt all ſorts of Workmen get in general, twice as much Wages as they do at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame will be evident alſo, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in this Country, which ought to have been at all times richer than <hi>France</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60783:32"/> to their reſpective bigneſs, the people pays ordinarily no Taxes or very ſmall ones, and conſequently the Sums which are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably imployed in <hi>France</hi> about maintaining great Armies of Soldiers and Exactors; and many other ſuch Caterpillers, as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which are all idle and troubleſom to the Working ſort of People; thoſe ſums, I ſay, are ſpent in <hi>England</hi> upon things which proceed from Man's Induſtry, whether they be neceſſary, or only for Ornament or Delight; which cauſes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation to ſpend more than any other Nation does therein, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Induſtry muſt needs be more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table there, than any where elſe; Not to mention here the greater number of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days which they have in <hi>France,</hi> as alſo a great number of People uſeleſs for work, of which I have ſpoke already, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, we muſt confeſs there was a conſiderable time when the <hi>French</hi> Nation got very much by its Induſtry, and by their Manfactures ſo much Deſired of their Neighbours, and for that reaſon very noxious to <hi>England</hi> in particular; 'tis true, that time did not laſt above 40 or 50 years, neither did the ſaid Manufactures take always at the ſame rate; during that time the <hi>French</hi> King did give Laws to his Neighbours, and made all Chriſtian Europe (not the Mahometan) to tremble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; till his Ambition has brought his Kingdom to that lamentable condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60783:32"/> it is at preſent, and which grows every day worſe and worſe; During thoſe 40 or 50 years, I do believe that the Revenue of the <hi>French</hi> Induſtry did go beyond the Revenue of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, and that if the laſt did amount to 400 Millions, the Profits of the Peoples Induſtry could be worth no leſs than 600 Millions of Livers. So that 'tis not ſo much to be wondred at, if the <hi>French</hi> King and the reſt of the Blood-ſuckers we ſpoke of before, did raiſe the great Sums already mentioned in that Kingdom. At preſent, thoſe Revenues and Profits of Induſtry, are at leaſt as much Decreaſed, as thoſe of their Real and Perſonal-Eſtates. For there are but few Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-men left, and no Work for them to do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be about the Manuring of a little Lands, wherein there is not much to be got, ſince the Arts, Manufactures, and Trade have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo much.</p>
               <p>So that there is reaſon to admire how that People can ſtill ſubſiſt, which I ſhall diſcover anon. But I muſt firſt ſhew, how we may come to the knowledge of the true Value of the Induſtry of a Nation.</p>
               <p>To comprehend well the Effect and Profit of the Labour of a People, the Number of Souls who compoſe a Nation, the Revenue of all its Eſtates Real and Perſonal, and the Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expenſe of the whole People muſt be known.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:60783:33"/>
               <p>For example, we ſaid that the Revenue of all the Eſtates Real and Perſonal in <hi>England,</hi> were worth 16 Millions Sterling, and 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuppoſed there are 6 Millions of Souls in it. To make a due Computation of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Expenſe, a <hi>Medium</hi> muſt be found of the Expenſe of each Soul one with another. Then we muſt ſee to what the whole will amount, and what goes beyond the 16 Millions Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, will be the Revenue or Profit of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Labour of the Nation. I think no better Rule can be found for it, than that of the Expenſe of a Journey man in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Such a man's Salary is commonly 8 pence a day, if he maintains himſelf, or 4 pence if he be maintained; and ſo his Food amounts to 2 ſhillings <hi>per</hi> week, or 5 pound Sterling, and 4 ſhill. <hi>per annum.</hi> For Cloaths, Lodging, and the reſt, no leſs can be reckoned than 36 ſhill. ſeeing the Wages of the pooreſt Servant-Maid in the Country, who gets no more than Food and Rayment is no leſs, and She ſpends it for her Cloaths and Shoes; in all 7 pound; according to this, all the Expenſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> will amount to 42 Millions Sterling; So that the Profit of the Labour of the People, at this rate, will be 26 Millions Sterling, which is almoſt the double of the Revenue of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, which are valued only at 16 Millions Sterling.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will be aſtoniſhed to ſee that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60783:33"/> we value at ſo ſmall a rate the Yearly Expenſe of every Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> 7 pound Sterling, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they ſee many, who, on their own Perſons, ſpend 15, nay, 20 times more, and that the People of <hi>England</hi> does in particular ſpend much more than any People whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And I own, that I have had ſome thoughts to put a higher Eſtimate upon the Expenſes of each perſon, one with another; but after, having well pondered and examined all things, I found it beſt to adhere to the Opinion of a very underſtanding Man, whom I follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject, and indeed, whoever will conſider how much the number of the Poor, their Wives and Children, does exceed that of the Rich, and that often one of thoſe poor Journey-men maintains a great Family by his ſole Labour, will judge that ſuch a Journey-man's Expenſe may very well ſerve as a Rule and Standard for the Expenſe of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken in general.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe then that the Proportion which we have laid down between the worth of the Real and Perſonal Eſtates of <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> be well grounded, and that <hi>France</hi> may be ſtill worth 10 Millions Sterling, <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> as <hi>England</hi> is worth 16 without Men's Labour; the ſame proportion may be alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, between the Profits of the Labour of both Nations; and as we reckoned the preſent Revenue of the Labour in <hi>England</hi> at 26 millions Sterling, we may alſo reckon,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60783:34"/> according to the ſame proportion, the Profits of the Labour in <hi>France</hi> to 15 millions Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: And in that manner, all the Revenues of <hi>France</hi> at this day, ſhould amount ſtill to 25 millions Sterling, that is, as well the Profit of their Labour, as the Revenues of Real and Perſonal-Eſtates. I profeſs, I do not believe their Labour riſes ſo high at this day; and I dare venture to ſay, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe above two thirds of the Labouring Men are either Dead, or in the Army; and I am of Opinion, that in ſtrictneſs it cannot amount to 10 Millions Sterling, but I am willing rather to allow them more than leſs.</p>
               <p>According to theſe Poſitions, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People in <hi>France,</hi> who are in number, as we ſuppoſed, about 9 Millions of Souls, could not ſpend above 30 Livers <hi>per annum,</hi> or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, one with another, that is to ſay, not ſo much as two pence every day.</p>
               <p>If the Reader has been ſurprized, that I did compute the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People's Expenſe to be only 4 pence every day, one with another, they will perhaps be much more ſurprized, that I value that of the <hi>French</hi> People no more than 2 pence for every working day, or 52 ſhill. <hi>per annum,</hi> upon which they muſt ſpare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withll to maintain themſelves? for more than a hundred days in the year, <hi>viz.</hi> Sundays and all their Holy-days, whereas the <hi>Engliſh-Man</hi> may work when he pleaſes, except Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and a very few other Holy-days.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60783:34"/>
               <p>And yet I proteſt again in ſincerity, that I do not think the Profit of their Labour goes ſo far, nor that it exceeds, as I have ſaid already, 10 Millions Sterling, at preſent; but I was willing to indulge them rather than otherwiſe, and ſo I leave them ſtill at two pence a day.</p>
               <p>'Tis the utmoſt we can put upon the value of the <hi>French</hi> People's Induſtry at this day, for a great many Reaſons which I ſhall reduce to ſome Heads. 1. The Value of Lands and People's Work, could never be ſo high in <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> nor their Expenſes by good conſequence, for the Reaſons above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; the Proximity of the Sea; the Great Trade; the Mildneſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Proteſtant Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the People of <hi>England</hi> ſpent always much more than thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> 2. The Fruits or Profits of the Labour of People could never be ſo great in <hi>France</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> as I proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 3. Above the two thirds of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Men in <hi>France</hi> have periſhed one way or other, as I ſaid before, and muſt often repeat it, and the exceſs of Miſery, under which that People groans, cannot be expreſſed. 4. There is no Trade within or without the Kingdom; Arts and Manufactures are all decayed, and a great part of the People are turned Beggars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe it ſeems to be impoſſible that the <hi>French</hi> People ſhould Live and Subſiſt at ſo little Expenſe, I muſt Diſcover how they do it; 'tis by conſuming their Stock, perhaps to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60783:35"/> value of above 4 or 500 Millions every Year, without reckoning the great and general Decay in all the Stocks and Revenues, cauſed by the Depopulation, which puts the Kingdom to the loſs of more than 2000 Millions yearly, during this War, as I could eaſily demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>'Tis not ſo much by ſelling away Lands, Houſes and Offices, that the People devours theſe 4 or 500 Millions of their Stock (tho' they may perhaps ſell ſome for the 10th or 12th part of their former value) as 'tis by ſelling away their Houſhold-Goods, Cattle, and Timber-Wood, their Plate and Jewels when there is any, or lending to thoſe who will never pay, or by borrowing, giving or taking to truſt, either their Money or Commodities, Labour or Time; by not paying their old Debts, which is a general Diſeaſe in all the Kingdom, and makes up a dreadful Article; or by ſelling and quitting their actual Debts for much leſs than they were worth formerly, and ſuch other uſual Ways, by which they waſte their Stock more and more; and yet for all this a great many dye of Hunger every day.</p>
               <p>To comprehend this matter the better, let us ſuppoſe a Man who had 30 years ago 100 pound of Revenue, and pays now the Taxes upon the Foot of the Ancient Revenue of his Land, and not upon the Foot of the preſent; for the Court Taxes all the Subjects now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient Eſtimate; that Man's Lands being fallen two thirds of their former
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60783:35"/> Revenue, if he pays only 30 pounds to the King Yearly, which would be look'd upon, now a days, as a great moderation; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for him of his Revenue; if he pays 50 or 100 <hi>l.</hi> as 'tis uſual now, for they are Taxed in that proportion, and worſe ſometimes, how can he pay that Tax, which is three times more than his Rent, and live without waſting the Stock? If, as I ſaid before, all the Eſtates, Real and Perſonal in the Kingdom are worth but 130 Millions of Livers; and that the King alone raiſes 200 which comes into his Coffers free, without that which is neceſſary to enrich the Farmers of Impoſitions, and to maintain 30 or 40 thouſand Men under them, at the People's Charges, called <hi>Gabeleurs,</hi> and <hi>Rats de Cave,</hi> &amp;c. and beſides to maintain the Officers of Judicature, and innumerable other Civil Officers, as I ſaid before, without mentioning the Clergy, who, by their Subtilty and Craft, do always Cheat and Plunder the People; If, I ſay, this be the State of affairs in <hi>France,</hi> we are obliged to believe that as the King, and all thoſe Ravenous Birds devour the Kingdom, every one is alſo forced to live upon the Quick, and devour his own Stock, and that ſo much the more, that the Clergy alone poſſeſs, as I have ſaid, the half of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, and do not contribute to the King proportionably as the other Subjects do, and therefore their Stock does not Decay ſo much, becauſe they are not obliged to Devour it, by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60783:36"/> reaſon that they can live very plentifully on their Rents, eſpecially conſidering that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench the great numbers of their Monks and Prieſts, without any inconveniency.</p>
               <p>I did above mention the Common Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which ſwallow up the whole Revenue of the People and more. What will it be then, when the King forces People, as he does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, to lend him Money, or to purchaſe his new Offices and Titles, or to take Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Wages, if Officers, or to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Adminſtration of ſome Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Functions; or when a Man, or his Father or Grand-Father, or any other to whom he may have ſome Relation, is Accuſed, and perhaps without any proofs, of having robbed the King or the People, and thereupon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to pay the King the greateſt part of all that he has? A hundred ſuch Methods are practiſed every day to the Ruine of the moſt Opulent Subjects all of a ſudden.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denyed that this is the Condition of <hi>France</hi> at this day, and that there are but very few, who do not conſume their Stock, except thoſe who never had any thing, and who help the King to deſtroy all.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, that as the <hi>French</hi> People live in the Country, thoſe poor Souls do not ſpend a penny a day in Food, one with another. The Country-People in <hi>Ireland</hi> feed much better than thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> eat their belly full of meat, when they pleaſe; nor don't want
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60783:36"/> Butter, Cheeſe, Bread, Potatos; and in many places they have abundance of Salt and Freſh-Water-Fiſh, Oyſters, Muſles, Crabs, Langoſts and Cockles; for, tho' they are very lazy, the Land is plentiful in all thoſe things, and then they pay almoſt no Taxes; and beſides, they ſmoak Tobaco Men, Women and Children; and notwithſtanding all this, Men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who know that Nation perfectly, and have Written concerning it, aſſure us, That they do not ſpend a penny a day, one with another, for their Dyet. They own indeed, that wearing commonly good Cloaths, they may ſpend, one with another, including their Rayment, about 2 pence <hi>per Diem,</hi> or 52 ſhill. <hi>per Annum;</hi> whereas the Country-People in <hi>France</hi> ſpends very little in Cloaths, at leaſt two thirds leſs than the People in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>France</hi> know, that moſt part of the Country-people did feed only upon Black-Bread before the War, neither had they their Belly full of that; and the beſt of their other cheer was ſome Fruits, Herbs and Roots, with ſowr Milk, without any Butter or Fat, unleſs ſome ſtinking Oyl of Walnut, or Rape-Seed, except it may be, in thoſe places where Olive-Trees are plentiful; they ſold their Butter to pay the Taille, and drank nothing but meer Water, or Water which had paſt over the drained Grapes, or Apples, when the Wine and Syder had been preſſed out of them; their chiefeſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60783:37"/> and almoſt only Food, was Black-Bread, or Rye-Bread baked with all the Bran, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very bad, that does not coſt a Half-penny <hi>per Pound,</hi> of which the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot eat three quarters of a pound a day, one with another, nor Men, who are at preſent in ſmall numbers, double that quantity. As for their Cloaths, Men, Women and Children are generally cloathed with courſe Linnen, ſuch as they make Sacks of, and wear Wooden-Shoes; and even many of 'em are bare-footed.</p>
               <p>If any Man ask, why the 9 Millions of Souls, which we ſuppoſe to be in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould not earn as much as the 6 millions of Souls ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the <hi>French</hi> work as much and as well as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſince there ought to be as many Working-Men amongſt the 9 Millions of <hi>French,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the 6 Millions of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I anſwer, beſides the reaſons I already produced, That more Money is to be got in a rich Place than in a poor One, in a populous Country, than in a depopulated One, in a Land abounding with Mines, and addicted to Manufactures, Fiſhery and Navigation, where there is plenty of Money, than in another which enjoys not thoſe Advantages, and where the Government is Arbitrary; Beſides, no body will deny but there is more gotten and ſpent in <hi>England,</hi> than <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at <hi>London</hi> than in <hi>Wales,</hi> and at <hi>Paris</hi> than in <hi>Bearn</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60783:37"/>
               <p>Nor is it true, that there are as many men fit for Work amongſt the 9 Millions of People in <hi>France,</hi> as there are amongſt the 6 Millions in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe, as I have ſaid often above, two thirds of the Men fit for Work in <hi>France,</hi> are periſhed, and of the remaining part one half is unprofitable for Work, and that thoſe who are unprofitable for Work, are three times more in number in <hi>France</hi> proportionably than they are in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that whereas <hi>England</hi> maintains the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War with leſs than 5 Millions Sterling Yearly, which does not make the third part of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates of all the Kingdom, leaving the Profits of the Labour of the People untouched, which are almoſt double to the Revenue of all the ſaid Eſtates. In a word, while <hi>England</hi> employs not above the 8th part of all its Revenues towards the War, the <hi>French</hi> King raiſing one way or other, about 200 Millions of Livers Yearly, upon his People ſince this War, draws from them above 70 Millions of Livers beyond the Revenue of all the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſince they are worth but 130 Millions, according to our Calculation. Upon which it is to be obſerved, that the Clergy, being in poſſeſſion of half of thoſe Eſtates in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe Revenue conſequently ought to amount yet to 65 Millions of Livers; the Clergy, I ſay, does not pay one Year with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 10 Millions of thoſe 200 which the King
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60783:38"/> raiſes, from whence it plainly appears, that the reſt of the Nation is beyond compariſon, much more oppreſſed than they are, and ſo much the more, that the Clergy is not ſo much vexed by the other Blood-ſuckers of the Nation, as the reſt of the Subjects are, and that they are themſelves of the number of the Leeches, which devour the Subſtance of the Nation, and by that means they enjoy yet above 55 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers free, beſides the Profits and Gains they make upon the People, by the Trade they drive of <hi>Holy Things,</hi> as they call them, and by a hundred cunning Tricks of their Art, which makes their Revenue of Profits, to amount to above 70 Millions of Livers yet. So that there are ſtill 70 Millions of Livers to be found for the King, as we have ſeen juſt now, above the 130 Millions, which are the Value of the Revenue of all the Eſtates in the Kingdom. For he muſt needs have no leſs than 200 Millions of Livers to maintain the War Yearly. If you ask, where we ſhall find them? I anſwer, Thoſe 70 Millions of Livers muſt needs be raiſed upon the Profit of Men's Labour, which we ſuppoſed might amount to 200 Millions of Livers Yearly, and then the remainder will be only 130 Millions.</p>
               <p>But then we muſt alſo deduce from thoſe 130 Millions of the Profits of Induſtry the 55 Millions which we ſaid the Clergy enjoyed (beſides what they gain by their cunning Tricks) out of the half of all the Revenues
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60783:38"/> Real and Perſonal of the Kingdom, which we gave to the King in the former Paragraphs; for the Clergy cannot be deprived of ſuch vaſt Revenues, ſeeing Cardinal <hi>Palavicini</hi> affirms, that our Saviour's chief intent in his coming into the World, has been to render the Clergy rich and happy according to the fleſh, <hi>felice ſecondo la Carne.</hi> So that thoſe 55 Millions muſt, as I ſaid, be taken upon the ſaid remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 130 Millions coming from the Revenues of the Labour of the Nation.</p>
               <p>So that the King and the Clergy having had their due ſhare of all, there remains no more than 75 Millions of Livers for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of all the reſt of the Nation, which may make about 8 Millions and 6 or 700 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls; for I think that the Clergy with the Monks and Nuns, and their Servants or Baſtards, may very well make up between 3 and 4 hundred thouſand Souls, which with the 8 Millions, 6 or 7 hundred thouſand Souls before, will make in all, the nine Millions of Souls which we ſuppoſed to be ſtill remaining in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſo then, that no more remains than 75 Millions of Livers for the ſubſiſtence of the reſt of the Nation, what ſhall we do with all the Officers of Judicature, Finances and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſo many others of a new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion? what ſhall we do with the Farmers general and particular of the Impoſts, with all their Crew? for all thoſe men have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60783:39"/> as aboveſaid, of all their Poſſeſſions and Revenues, the King has ſwallowed up all by his 200 Millions which he muſt raiſe for his Armies. Where ſhall we find wherewithall to furniſh the uſual Covetouſneſs, and authorized Cheats of the Clergy, who, as we ſaid before, are ſtill plundering and pillaging the Nation by their Falſe and Counterfeit Devotions, and Robbing the People, tho' never ſo miſerable, of 15 Millions of Livers at leaſt <hi>per Annum.</hi> But let us leave this laſt Article concerning their Robberies for the 10 Millions which I ſaid above the Clergy may pay now to the King during the War every Year.</p>
               <p>We have ſtill all the Officers of Judicature, and the reſt named in the foregoing Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, to maintain. We cannot allow them leſs than the ſaid 75 Millions of Livers which remain of the Profits of the National Induſtry, and their ſhare will be very ſmall too; for 'tis probable they did altogether draw above 200 Millions yearly from the Subſtance of the People, beſides their Patrimonial Goods, which are included in the Kings 200 <hi>millions per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that manner, there remains nothing for all the reſt of the Nation; for all the Nobility, Peaſants, Mechanicks, Artiſts, Manufacturers, Merchants, Sea-men, and all other Orders of People.</p>
               <p>Moreover, beſides all this, the Debts of the Kingdom are unpaid, I mean, the Debts of all the Subjects one to another.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60783:39"/>
               <p>I ſaid already, that the Revenue of all the Eſtates, both Real and Perſonal in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Kingdom ſtands in, would not be able to pay the Intereſt of the ſaid Debts, nor is the Value of all the Stocks able to pay the Principal. Let us ſuppoſe that the Intereſt of them goes not beyond 130 Millions of Livers, which is the Eſtimation we made of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Revenue of all Eſtates whatſoever. That's already 130 Millions of the Stock of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſpent every year, without reckoning any thing for Intereſt upon Intereſt.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we find wherewithal to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the reſt of the Nation? 'tis plain, it cannot be done but by the Conſumption of all their Stocks, as I ſaid before, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption cannot be under 3 or 4 hundred Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi> beſides the Intereſt of Debts, of which I ſpoke juſt now. I have mentioned the Ways alſo, by which that Conſumption is made, and therefore I will not repeat them here; tho' I am obliged too often to do it, becauſe very few will comprehend the meaning of my firſt Principles upon the firſt hint;</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ask, what ſhare I judge the Nobility might have in the 4 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Millions of Livers of Revenue, to which I ſuppoſed, all the Eſtates Real and Perſonal might have amounted thirty Years ago, or in the 130 millions to which we reduce it at preſent.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60783:40"/>
               <p>I anſwer, that I do not think the Nobility ever had above the 13th part of the whole, that is to ſay, about 30 Millions of Livers, formerly, and not above 10 at this day.</p>
               <p>For we muſt always remember that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy poſſeſſes half of the whole; and I think the <hi>Third Eſtate</hi> (which comprehends all thoſe who are neither of the Nobility, nor of the Clergy) poſſeſſes 5 times as much Revenue as all the Nobility: All which I ſubmit to the Judgment of Underſtanding Men.</p>
               <p>This Chapter may appear to be very full of difficulty to thoſe who are not accuſtomed to ſuch Speculations and Computations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire them to read it over twice, that they may underſtand it better; perhaps they will not loſe their pains, if they do it. The next Chapter will be more eaſie and diverting, and may help much to confirm what I have ſaid in this, in relation to the Value of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, and of the Profits of Induſtry in both Kingdoms.</p>

               <head>CHAP III. That <hi>ENGLAND</hi> is, and ought to be more Populous, proportionably to its bigneſs, than <hi>FRANCE</hi> was, even before the War.</head>
               <p>I Have undertaken to prove that <hi>England</hi> is more Populous proportionably to its big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than <hi>France</hi> was, even before the War; I will not ſay, that <hi>England</hi> is more Populous than <hi>France</hi> is at preſent, for no body, I believe, queſtions that, or if they do, I could prove it by one ſole Argument, which is this, That the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is much Bigger, and more Populous than <hi>Paris,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>France,</hi> tho' <hi>England</hi> contains but 30 Millions of Acres, whereas <hi>France</hi> contains 82 Millions, according to Sir <hi>Will, Petty;</hi> And moreover, <hi>England</hi> has near as many other good Towns as <hi>France</hi> has proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to their reſpective bigneſſes; for, as I have already ſaid, <hi>England</hi> compared to <hi>France,</hi> is but as four to eleven. Some may perhaps judge at firſt, that this conſequence is not pregnant and indeed I confeſs the thing wants explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore to comprehend it the better, we will ſuppoſe the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> to be divided into 11 Parts, or Provinces of an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60783:41"/> equal bigneſs, and that <hi>England</hi> is no bigger than 4 of thoſe Parts united together, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that proportion, <hi>London,</hi> which muſt be in one of thoſe four ſuppoſed Provinces of <hi>England,</hi> and is the Head-City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ought not to be much bigger than the third part of the Head-City of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> viz. <hi>Paris;</hi> ſo that the two other third parts of <hi>London</hi> ſhould remain to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among the three other ſuppoſed Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any one may eaſily conceive upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that thoſe four Provinces of <hi>England</hi> muſt be proportionably more populous than the eleven of <hi>France,</hi> ſince we can make out of thoſe two ſuperfluous third parts of <hi>London</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral large Cities which will render thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſo much the more populous, that they muſt needs have as much more People in the Country, to ſupply them with all ſorts of Victuals and other neceſſary things, as there ſhall be in the ſaid new Cities, beyond the number of People which there may be already in the ſaid Provinces.</p>
               <p>But to form a more particular and diſtinct Idea of the bigneſs of thoſe two great Capital Cities, and of the number of their reſpective People, upon which our proof is grounded, we muſt underſtand the number of Houſes and Inhabitants of both places, as near as can be.</p>
               <p>There were at <hi>Paris,</hi> 10 or 11 years ago,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60783:41"/> according to the Relation of Maſter <hi>Azout,</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> King's famouſeſt Mathematicians, 23255 Houſes, which did contain, as he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 80 thouſand Families, <hi>viz.</hi> three Families and a half of 6 Perſons each in one Houſe with another, comprehending in that number the <hi>Hotels,</hi> or Noblemens great Houſes, but excepting out of it 38 Colledges, which 23255 Houſes, as he pretended, did contain in all 488-055 Souls.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who come from that City every day, and ſuch as were born there, confeſs that very few Houſes have been built lately upon new Foundations, but only that ſome ſmall ones have been pull'd down in pitiful narrow Streets, to rebuild them Larger and more Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which does not increaſe, but rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes the number of the Houſes; and they all agree, that there is a third part leſs people in <hi>Paris</hi> than there was 10 or 11 years ago: But I ſhall notwithſtanding allow Mr. <hi>Azout</hi>'s number.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>London,</hi> the Rolls of the <hi>Chimney-Money,</hi> left by the Collectors, tell us, there was 10 or 11 years ago, 105 thouſand Houſes, ſince which time, at leaſt 15 thouſand have been built in places where never any old Foundation ſtood, beſides the augmentation made every day to many old Houſes, which are rebuilt higher, &amp; more commodious than they were before, beſides above 11 thouſand Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars inhabited. I grant there are ſeveral Houſes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60783:42"/> empty, but then I ſhall agree that thoſe Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſhould not be reckoned, that ſo we may fill the 120 thouſand Houſes.</p>
               <p>Then ſuppoſing that there are 7 Souls in each Houſe, one with another, either in one Family, or in two, it will amount to 840 thouſand Souls. I do not think any Man can fairly refuſe to admit 7 Souls in all the Houſes of <hi>London,</hi> one with another, ſince we conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to admit 20 in thoſe of <hi>Paris, viz.</hi> three times as many, and that we do alſo lay aſide the inhabited Cellars of <hi>London,</hi> to ſupply the vacancy of the empty Houſes; without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting or abating them that might be alſo empty at <hi>Paris,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Azout</hi> did write, of which he takes no notice, and alſo without mentioning the multitude of Men, who are at all times lodged upon Ships in the River at <hi>London;</hi> and if I were of a contradicting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I could juſtifie from reaſon, and matter of fact, that there never was 14 Souls in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Houſe of <hi>Paris,</hi> one with another; nay, perhaps not 12. For, I believe I have ſtudied <hi>Paris</hi> in relation to this Point, as long and as exactly as any perſon whatever. I will make bold to ſay here, notwithſtanding the reſpect due to ſo great and ingenious a Man as Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> that he did miſtake in that Point, making <hi>London</hi> leſs populous, and <hi>Paris</hi> more populous than they really were; tho' I muſt confeſs, that I believe he did it out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60783:42"/>
               <p>Then if <hi>London</hi> did contain no more People proportionably than <hi>Paris</hi> the Head-City of a Kingdom near 3 times as big, there ought not to be above 180 thouſand Souls in it; ſo that the Overplus, <hi>viz.</hi> 660 thouſand Souls, ſhould remain to be divided among the three other Provinces of the 4 ſuppoſed to be in <hi>England.</hi> Let us divide thoſe 660 thouſand Souls in three parts, and make three other Cities for the three other Provinces, to be the Head-Cities there, as <hi>London</hi> is in the fourth, they will be ſuch Cities for multitude of people, as the like will hardly be found in <hi>Germany, Italy, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> Or if that be not ſo well, let us divide them in 13 Cities of above 50 thouſand Souls apiece, it will make four great Cities for every one of the three Provinces, and one beſides for the fourth Province, of which we ſuppoſe <hi>London</hi> to be the Head-City: All thoſe Cities added to thoſe that are already in the Kingdom, would make it appear extraordinarily populous. So that by this, any one may eaſily judge, that <hi>England</hi> is more populous than <hi>France</hi> was thirty years ago, or rather, than it ever was. For, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, thoſe 13 Cities of 50 thouſand Souls apiece, ſhould contain perhaps as much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (if you conſult judicious Men about it, and not the Rabble, who are impertinent Judges in thoſe Matters) than did ever the 13 largeſt Cities in <hi>France, Paris</hi> excepted.</p>
               <p>It muſt be conſidered further, as I intimated
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60783:43"/> before, that there muſt needs be added near as many Souls in Farmers and other Country-people, to ſupply thoſe new Cities with all ſorts of Victuals and Proviſions, beyond the number of people in the ſaid 13 Cities, beſides that which is already in the 3 ſuppoſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces diſtinguiſhed from the 4th, in which <hi>London</hi> ſtands. Since it is certain, there needs almoſt as much people in the Country, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and carry all Neceſſaries to a great City, as there is of People in the ſaid City. So that I leave it to any Man to judge how populous thoſe Provinces would be. I confeſs that the adjacent parts to <hi>London</hi> would become ſo much the leſs populous; but however, they would be ſtill as populous as are commonly the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts of the Head-Cities in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whoſe bigneſs &amp; populouſneſs holds more proportion to the other parts of the Nation than <hi>London</hi> doth; for it muſt be granted that <hi>London</hi> is a Monſter amongſt Cities, and that it holds no proportion to the reſt of <hi>England,</hi> the Head being three times too big for the Body.</p>
               <p>The thing may perhaps be more eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended another way, which may poſſibly be more intelligible to many. I affirm there are as many People in <hi>London,</hi> according to the former Computation, as there were thirty years ago in all the Cities and Towns of the four biggeſt Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> which are, <hi>Languedock,</hi> with the <hi>Cevennes, Vivarez</hi> and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60783:43"/> 
                  <hi>Velay,</hi> which do belong to that Province, <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Normandy</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> which may all together, with the addition of two or three Millions of Acres contain near as much ground as <hi>England,</hi> reckoning 160 Towns great and ſmall in the ſaid four Provinces, 40 for every one of them, one with another.</p>
               <p>I allow 60 thouſand Souls to every one of their Chief Cities, one with another; which is 240000.</p>
               <p>I know there might be more in <hi>Thoulouze</hi> and <hi>Roüen,</hi> two of the ſaid four Cities, but it may be on the other hand there was not half of that number in the two other Capital Cities. But if any man notwithſtanding this, ſhould fancy that I allow to thoſe Cities too few People, he may be pleaſed to conſider, that in <hi>Dublin</hi> which is bigger than <hi>Roüen,</hi> there is but 7 thouſand Houſes, and not above 5 thouſand at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which is a Town conſiderable for its bigneſs.</p>
               <p>I allow to 4 other Cities 30 thouſand Souls apiece. Which is 120000

               <p>As for the reſt, who bear the name of Towns, tho' they deſerve hardly that of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,

               <p>In all 8-40000.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> alone conſumeth more Proviſions and Commodities of all ſorts, than do all the ſaid 160 Towns, even tho' we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I grant indeed, if there were no other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns in <hi>England,</hi> the Reaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed might be confuted, by ſaying, that 'tis no wonder <hi>London</hi> ſhould be ſo populous, there being no other Towns in <hi>England;</hi> but I make bold to ſay, it were not hard to find in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 160 other Towns as good, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the 160 ſuppoſed to be in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid 4 Provinces of <hi>France.</hi> And it were an eaſie matter to find 30 among the reſt, who would be better perhaps one with another, than 30 of the beſt in the ſaid Provinces of <hi>France.</hi> As for example, <hi>Briſtol, Newcaſtle, York, Norwich, Plymouth, Exeter, Cheſter, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſler, Hull, Scarborough, Halifax, Taunton, Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Portſmouth, Dorcheſter, Wincheſter, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Leiceſter, Glouceſter, Shrewsbury, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Salisbury, Coventry, Birmigham, Oxford, Cambridge, Peterborough, Lincoln, Canterbury, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, Litchfield, Rocheſter, Reding, Ypſwitch, Durham, Derby, Carliſle, Northampton, Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Lyn, Leeds, Liverpoole, Barnſtaple, White-Haven, Bediford;</hi> and ſeveral others which are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60783:44"/> bigger than ſome of them have I named, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps above 200, of which the leſt contains above a thouſand Souls apiece.</p>
               <p>It is to be conſidered, that there are in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 641 Market-Towns, which are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good Towns. I queſtion very much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſo many in the two Third-parts of the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and 'tis certain, the Engliſh Market-Towns are commonly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thoſe of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why Foreigners travelling in <hi>England,</hi> and even Engliſh-men themſelves, do judge <hi>England</hi> not to be ſo populous, nor ſo Rich as <hi>France,</hi> is, firſt that they think a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon may be reaſonably made betwixt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and that there is an equality between them, and then after that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve there are ſeveral other great Towns in <hi>France,</hi> and do not think that there are any in <hi>England</hi> which ſeem to deſerve that name.</p>
               <p>They do not take notice, as they ſhould, of the prodigious Bigneſs of <hi>London,</hi> which they don't think ſo big as it really is, becauſe they don't know the half of it, even not after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months reſidence in it, becauſe it is not ſo compact as <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſome other great Towns, but extraordinarily and irregularly extended; and becauſe People commonly neglect to viſit ſeveral great parts of it, where they judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſerves to be ſeen, by reaſon that there is ſeldom any of the Nobility, great Lawyers, or rich Merchants, that live in thoſe parts, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60783:45"/> only a great multitude of the vulgar ſort, who live in Lanes, Allies, and Courts without number, where the ways are very hard to be found, and unknown, even to a great many of the Inhabitants of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do not take notice alſo of the Cellars, where great numbers of People dwell.</p>
               <p>They do not know, or at leaſt do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there is a prodigious number of Manufactures of all ſorts, in a much greater number than at <hi>Paris,</hi> which employ a vaſt multitude of People at home on the working days, without mentioning the great number of thoſe who are continually aboard the Ships in the River, or upon the Keys.</p>
               <p>Another Errour which they commit in the compariſon of <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>London,</hi> is this, that they do not diſtinguiſh the River of <hi>Seine,</hi> which runs thro' the very middle of <hi>Paris,</hi> and which in ſeveral places is divided in two Branches or Heads, and contains a very great ſpace of ground; they do not, I ſay, diſtinguiſh that River from the body of the City, as if the ſpace which it takes up, was a Continent of Houſes and Streets, and they do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are many Bridges upon that River in the middle of the City, amongſt which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral are covered with Houſes, ſo that People paſs every day over thoſe Bridges, without taking any notice that they are Bridges; whereas in the Eſtimate they make of the Bigneſs of <hi>London,</hi> they never fail to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60783:45"/> the <hi>Thames</hi> from <hi>London;</hi> whereas, if they did comprehend it with <hi>London,</hi> as they do the <hi>Seine</hi> with <hi>Paris,</hi> they ſhould find in the River <hi>Thames</hi> alone a greater ſpace of ground than that which <hi>Paris</hi> takes up with its Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Lambeth</hi> to <hi>Blackwall.</hi> But they may perhaps ſay, that there are more Squares in <hi>London</hi> than <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the River <hi>Seine</hi> ought to go for thoſe Squares. I anſwer, that the River <hi>Seine</hi> takes up ten times more ſpace than the ſaid Squares do. Beſides, there are ſo many Convents and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries at <hi>Paris</hi> with vaſt Incloſures, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Incloſures beſides which are not built up, as alſo ſeveral Palaces, Hotels and great Houſes, with greater Gardens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures than we have at <hi>London,</hi> except St. <hi>James's Park,</hi> which they do alſo diſtinguiſh from <hi>London</hi> in their eſtimate of its Bigneſs, whereas they comprehend all the ſaid Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures within <hi>Paris,</hi> when they compare it to <hi>London;</hi> and notwithſtanding all this, even allowing them the Liberty to comprehend all thoſe things within <hi>Paris,</hi> and not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>Thames,</hi> and the ſaid Squares, and St. <hi>James's Park</hi> within <hi>London.</hi> I ſay, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them this, I believe ſtill that <hi>London</hi> takes up more ground than <hi>Paris</hi> by half.</p>
               <p>Nor do they mind, when they compare the multitude of People in <hi>England</hi> with that of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> is but a little more in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than the Third part of <hi>France,</hi> tho' at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60783:46"/> other times, when comparing both the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms one with another, they make <hi>England</hi> leſſer than 'tis; which are miſtakes very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to Mankind.</p>
               <p>But that which contributes moſt to confirm them in their Opinion to the diſadvantage of <hi>England,</hi> is, that when they are travelling in <hi>England,</hi> they do not meet, as I obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, with ſuch a great number of large Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as they do, when travelling in <hi>France.</hi> The reaſon of which is very plain, or rather ſeveral reaſons may be alledged for it. Firſt, The City of <hi>London</hi> is too big, as I ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for the reſt of the Kingdom, and draws in the People of the Country to it, more than any Head City of any other Nation known to us, and will continue to do ſo more and more. Secondly, The other moſt conſiderable Towns in <hi>England,</hi> are for the moſt part ſituated near the Sea, whither few Travellers go, whereas in <hi>France</hi> they are almoſt all of them placed in the Inand Countries, and upon the great Roads. So that 'tis no wonder, if Travellers do not meet with ſo many great Towns in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and even find ſometimes a kind of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, ſince 'tis chiefly the Sea-Coaſts which are well peopled, and where the good Towns lye.</p>
               <p>There's one thing further to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> That Travellers in <hi>France</hi> do propoſe commonly to themſelves nothing elſe, but to take their Pleaſure, and learn the Tongue,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60783:46"/> with ſome bodily Exerciſes which are not very neceſſary, and don't apply their Minds to learn the condition of the Provinces of that Kingdom, &amp; ſo for the moſt part they travel only thro' the pleaſanteſt, moſt populous and luxurious parts of <hi>France,</hi> where Victuals and Fruits are moſt Delicate, and other pleaſures moſt Exquiſite: They ſee <hi>Paris, Roüen, Orleans,</hi> with all the other Places upon the River <hi>Loire, Angers, Lion, Marſeille, Montpellier, Niſmes, Thoulouze, Bourdeaux, Poictiers,</hi> and ſome <hi>Rochelle;</hi> but very few travel through the Provinces of <hi>Brittain, Mainne, Perche, Vendomois,</hi> where they might find great Wilderneſſes, and in many Parts few People. They travel ſeldom thro' the Provinces of <hi>Berry, Bourbonnois, Auvergne, Cevennes, Daufinè, Provence, Nivernois, Limozin, Quercy, Bearn,</hi> and ſeveral other conſiderable Parts of the Kingdom, where few great Towns are to be found; So that Foreigners ſee only the moſt populous Parts of <hi>France,</hi> and not the other Parts, quite contrary to them who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel thro' <hi>England,</hi> who ſee the leſs populous parts, and do not ſee the other.</p>
               <p>This reaſon will alſo furniſh us with another, <hi>viz.</hi> That Strangers take notice of, and love Towns, according to the pleaſure they enjoyed in them. Now 'tis known, that <hi>London</hi> is the only place in <hi>England,</hi> where Men of Pleaſure or Curioſity find their Delights. There is little or no Gallantry in the other Towns; few great and handſome Buildings, or fine
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60783:47"/> Walks; few Nobility and Gentry; few Plays, as <hi>Opera's, Comedies,</hi> &amp;c. no Thennis-Courts almoſt, or other Games, as Pall-Mall, Billiard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Muſick, or acceptable Socleties of Learned Men, the two Univerſities excepted, few or no extraordinary Cooks, where one may find good treatment. The Streets of the Towns are narrow, ill paved, and worſe clean'd; and for thoſe reaſons, <hi>England</hi> in general, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and the two Univerſities excepted, is look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon as uncultivated by travelling Men, who love pleaſure, neatneſs and delicacy; whereas they may find in <hi>France</hi> above 30 Towns as pleaſant and diverting as <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, where People underſtand themſelves as well. They had ten <hi>Parliament Cities,</hi> about twenty <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,</hi> as many <hi>Generalities,</hi> or Offices of Treaſurers in <hi>France,</hi> a great number of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Towns with notable Courts of Juſtice, called <hi>Preſidials;</hi> and Foreigners take much notice of all thoſe things, which helps to render that Country acceptable &amp; delightful, &amp; makes it appear rich and populous to them. They find in all thoſe places excellent Cooks or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at reaſonable rates, delicate Wines &amp; Fruits, Comedies and Plays of all ſorts, fine Walks, and Courts of Governours, Intendants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a multitude of Noted Men in the Offices of Judicature, Finances, and Civil-Government, who make a great ſhow in their Towns with a ſmall Revenue well managed; curious and well-bred People, learned Men; others curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60783:47"/> in their pleaſures, and fit for any Society: There they have alſo Civil and Ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, free in their Converſation, yet honeſt for the moſt part; they alſo ſee ſeveral fair Buildings, as well Private as Publick, ſuch as Gentlemens Houſes, Churches and Convents, and at ſome diſtance from the Towns, there are frequently ſeveral ſtately Houſes with handſom Gardens belonging to the chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Towns. All thoſe things charm Foreigners, and did mightily conduce to the drawing in of Strangers to that Country, and to inrich it by that means. It had alſo this effect, that Strangers took it to be more populous and rich than really it was; and I confeſs that it was indeed full of People, but not ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous as it ought to have been, nor yet ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous as <hi>England,</hi> proportionably to their reſpective Extents. As for Politeneſs, and Refinedneſs in many things, I confeſs <hi>France</hi> did go beyond <hi>England,</hi> but that is not the thing in Queſtion. We may indeed ſay in that reſpect, that there were many Courts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Cities in <hi>France,</hi> and but one in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems likewiſe that there are not ſo many Houſes in the Country in <hi>England,</hi> out of the Towns and Borroughs, as are in <hi>France.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe of the Reaſons above-mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That good Towns are in general towards the Sea-Coaſts, and that People chuſe rather to live thereabouts than in the midſt of the Land. And,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60783:48"/> Secondly, Becauſe the adjacent Parts of <hi>London</hi> as well as the City it ſelf, contributes very much towards the depopulating of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Thirdly, It muſt be conſidered, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple apply themſelves commonly more in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the breeding of Cattle, than they do in <hi>France,</hi> and that a Farm in <hi>England</hi> takes up a greater extent of Land by reaſon of their Cattle, which are very numerous, and go of 'emſelves a great way to the appointed Paſture without a Herd, becauſe they are free from Wolves; and in ſuch a Farm there is commonly a greater number of People proportionably than in the Farms in <hi>France,</hi> where they are leſſer for the moſt part, and more frequent. The <hi>French</hi> Plow more, and have Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeards; which require a greater number of ſmall Houſes diſperſed to and fro. But the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs and Villages are commonly larger, more lively and populous in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> not only becauſe of the greater fruitfulneſs of the Soil, and the lenity of the Government, but alſo becauſe the Cattle maintaineth a great number of Manufactures, by their Wooll, Hides, Horns, Tallow, Butter, Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that abundance of Farmers live in them.</p>
               <p>We muſt conſider alſo that there is in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> an incredible number of People imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Mines, either of Tin, Copper, Lead, Coals or Iron, who are almoſt all upon the Coaſts, which Travellers cannot ſee, becauſe they do not go that way.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60783:48"/>
               <p>Another thing to be taken notice of, is, that there are in <hi>England</hi> above 70 Sea-ports, where three Maſt-Ships may Ride ſafely at Anchor; beſides a great many leſs conſiderable Ports, whereas in <hi>France,</hi> tho' a much larger Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there is hardly the fourth part of that number.</p>
               <p>They reckon indeed but ten thouſand Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in <hi>England,</hi> which is not much more than the third part of the 27 thouſand Pariſhes in <hi>France,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pariſhes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more populous.</p>
               <p>We have another Proof both of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People in <hi>England</hi> and of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Government, and if it may be ſpoken without offence, of the bad Diſcipline kept in the Kingdom at the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious multitude of Shop-Keepers in <hi>London,</hi> which is 6 times the number of thoſe in <hi>Paris,</hi> and 12 times the number of thoſe in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and many of them are idle perſons who betake themſelves to ſuch imployments meerly to avoid working, turn Bankrupt every day, and ruine others. What an incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Victualling-Houſes, Taverns, Ale-Houſes, Coffee-Houſes; and what a vaſt quantity of Houſes where they ſell Brandy, and Tobacco, and of others who let out Rooms furniſhed and unfurniſhed. We know there is need of ſuch ſort of people, but they are three times more numerous than they ought to be. What an innumerable multitude of Young
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60783:49"/> Women is there, who have neither Eſtate nor Trade, and yet are very ſumptuouſly Cloathed, and live High? All thoſe things argue a great multitude of People in a Country, which, notwithſtanding ſuch Diſorders, is indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well peopled, and would be a great deal more populous, if good Rule and Diſcipline were obſerved in it.</p>
               <p>We find alſo that the Wages of Servants, both Men and Women, are cheaper at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> than they were at <hi>Paris</hi> 30 years ago, where an ordinary Servant Maid had 50 or 60 Livers <hi>per Annum,</hi> and a Cook-Maid above 100 Livers, beſides the Wine allowed her or Money in the room of it, whereas they are a great deal cheaper in <hi>London;</hi> and we know, that for 25 or 30 Leagues round <hi>Paris,</hi> a Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or a Shepherd, had 40 and 45 Crowns of Wages Yearly, whereas ſuch Men in <hi>England</hi> are to be had for leſs than the half of that Money.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe Reaſons, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who travel in <hi>England,</hi> where they ſee but few great Towns, will always be apt to think that we are miſtaken, and retain their own Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was more Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>France</hi> 30 years ago, than is in <hi>England</hi> at preſent. Let us then make another ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to convince them once for all.</p>
               <p>We have already demonſtrated, that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>London</hi> to be no more populous in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the bigneſs of <hi>England,</hi> than <hi>Paris</hi> is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60783:49"/> in proportion to the bigneſs of <hi>France,</hi> 650 thouſand Souls might be drawn out of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to form 13 other Cities of 50 thouſand Souls apiece, and as many people proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly out of the adjacent parts of <hi>London;</hi> becauſe they are more populous than the reſt of the Kingdom, by reaſon of the Neighbourhood of that great City.</p>
               <p>Then let any Man diſtribute, as he ſhall think fit, thoſe 13 Cities of 50 thouſand Souls a-piece, or if he Judges more convenient, 26 Cities of 25 thouſand Souls each; I ſay, let him diſtribute them with all the Country-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neceſſary for ſupplying them with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, amongſt the Shires of <hi>England</hi> who want moſt People, and then let him freely give his Judgment, whether he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>England</hi> ſhould have a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of larger Cities, and more People propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably than <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part, ſince I don't know how to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall divide em 'mongſt the chiefeſt roads in <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch parts of the Kingdom, which, I am informed, are in moſt want of People. I place firſt of all, two of thoſe Cities of 50 thouſand Souls a-piece in <hi>Wales,</hi> which may be divided, if it be thought beſt, in 4 Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of 25 thouſand Souls a-piece; ſo that all the parts of the Country might have a ſhare of them. Then I place three other of thoſe Cities of 50 thouſand Souls, or ſix of 25 thouſand a-piece upon the Road betwixt <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60783:50"/> and <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> thoſe Cities added to <hi>York</hi> which is already in that Road, would make the Land look very populous. I place further two of the ſaid Cities of 50 thouſand Souls, or four of 25 thouſand each, upon the Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Cheſter.</hi> I place two likewiſe of 50 thouſand, or four of 25 thouſand upon the Roads from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Exeter, Plymouth,</hi> and <hi>Cornwall.</hi> As for the 4 other Cities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, I ſhould alſo make 8 out of them, of 25 thouſand Souls a piece, and place one of the number betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> one between <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> one between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> one between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and the other in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> or in any other manner which ſhould be found better, for it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more convenient to add theſe eight laſt to thoſe places already named, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>Briſtol, Portſmouth, Norwich, Dover, Harwich, Oxford, Cambridg</hi> and <hi>Carliſle,</hi> to make them up great Cities.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe further, ſince ſuppoſitions coſt us nothing, that there were one hundred or two hundred Families able to keep Coaches of their own, in each of thoſe Cities, and abundance of Well-bred People, Learned and Curious in all ſort of Diſciplines and Noble Arts, and who underſtand the World well; ſeveral delicate Publick-houſes to eat and drink,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60783:50"/> with exquiſite Cooks, who could treat well for a little Money, with quantities of all ſorts of Fowl, both wild and tame, good Wine, delicate Fruits, and very cheap; that the ſaid Cities were neat, well built, in good Air, with ſeveral fine Squares, ſtately Buildings within and without, both Publick and Private, curious Walks and Gardens, all ſorts of Games, as Tennis, Mall, Billiard and others, Comedies, Ballets, Muſick, of all kinds, good Maſters for all ſorts of Sciences, for the Exerciſes of the Body, and for Muſical Inſtruments; ſeveral exquiſite and rare Artiſts in all things relating either to Ornament, Curioſity or Pleaſure; and above all the reſt, the People courteous, civil, obliging, and always ready to ſerve Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for little or nothing, as in <hi>France;</hi> I ſay, if all thoſe things were to be found in twenty or thirty great Cities in <hi>England,</hi> no queſtion but Travellers would not only be better pleaſed with them, than they are now, but alſo would think <hi>England</hi> to be much more populous than they do now; We are apt to forget the great Towns where we had no pleaſure, and ſaw no curioſity, as if we had met with no living Soul in them, or as if all the Inhabitants had been meer <hi>Clowns</hi> and <hi>Peaſants,</hi> and not <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized People.</hi> The Country-Towns in <hi>France,</hi> had, I confeſs, a great advantage in all thoſe things, over the Towns in <hi>England;</hi> but it muſt be granted alſo, that no wealth or eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to be found any where elſe, for the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60783:51"/> Country-people was plunged in an incredible Miſery, and the Nobility ruined; the Cities and Towns did drain all the Wealth and Money, both by receiving the King's Taxes, and by an infinite number of Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature and Finances, and by the Clergy and <hi>Maltotiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry who have been in <hi>France,</hi> remember they found great ſatisfaction in ſeveral Cities and Towns of that Kingdom, which, for that reaſon, make ſtill a conſiderable Impreſſion on their Minds, whereas they know no place in <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>London,</hi> that is acceptable to them, for pleaſures and curioſity. But yet this doth not argue, that <hi>France</hi> was ever ſo populous, as <hi>England</hi> is even at preſent.</p>
               <p>To all the reaſons from matter of Fact al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged already, to prove that <hi>England</hi> is more populous proportionably to its bigneſs, than <hi>France</hi> was 30 years ago, and conſequently richer. I ſhall add ſeveral others to ſhew that it muſt be ſo, and ſhall repeat thoſe already hinted, that they may be ſeen together.</p>
               <p>I muſt intreat the Reader here to redouble his Attention, becauſe, tho' the Subject which I handle in this place, and the Reaſons that I ſhall alledge, are fitted to the capacity of all ſorts of People, yet they are of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially thoſe that I ſhall produce in the beginning, which ſhow the miſchiefs which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60783:51"/> Popery brings upon Nations ſubject to it. There you will find Arguments againſt Popery, which being neither Theological, nor Philoſophical, but only Political, may perhaps make a greater impreſſion upon Princes and their Councils (who commonly have regard for nothing elſe but their own Temporal Intereſt, or that of their People) than all the Reaſons adduced from Scripture commonly do, tho' they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely of more weight. Some Heads will be ſomething long, but they are of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. This is a Field that hath not hitherto been ſufficiently plowed, and which in time may, with God's bleſſing, bring forth a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harveſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Proteſtant Religion does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Eccleſiaſticks to live at the Charge of the People, as the Clergy of the pretended Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do, who pillage and exhauſt them, there being not a Year even at preſent, notwithſtanding the general Miſery of the Subjects, but they get from them, one way or other, above 15 Millions of Livers, by their ridiculous unſcriptural Devotions and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and thouſands of Tricks and Cheats, which contributing to the Ruine of the People, is deſtructive to Propagation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are ſix Church-men in <hi>France,</hi> at leaſt, for one in <hi>England,</hi> proportionably to the reſpective bigneſs of both Kingdoms, tho' its known that we do not want Church-men
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60783:52"/> in <hi>England,</hi> and by conſequence there are ſo many Subjects more in <hi>France</hi> that do not work, and are not uſeful to the Nation, except a very ſmall number of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In particular, the Mendicant Fryers are extreamly burthenſom to the Kingdom, being altogether uſeleſs, whereas among the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergy, the Biſhops with their Canons, the Curates, and part of their Prieſts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the ordinary ſervice of their pretended Church, ſuch as it is; And thoſe Begging-Monks are yet more intolerable in this than the Indowed Monks, that by their voluntary and baſe beggarlineſs they are very chargeable to the People, who muſt maintain them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, one way or other: For they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a plentiful Table, and drink abundance of Wine, while a great many honeſt Men, and ſuch as are uſeful to the Nation have no Bread to eat. This ſort of Monks do moreover a great prejudice to the Real Poor, for they can find no Bread, becauſe the Monks exhauſt the Charity of the People. And further, they out-do all the reſt of the Clergy in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cricy and Ignorance, by their pretences to a great Mortification, draw in abundance of Young and Handſom Ladies, who chuſe them for their Confeſſors, whereby great unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are practiſed. 'Tis thought there are above ſixty thouſand of this ſort in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And ſuppoſe they coſt the Nation but 6 pence a day, one with another, it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60783:52"/> to near 7 Millions of Livers Yearly. That's the leaſt they ſpend, for they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the beſt Towns, where they live daintily; but they take always great care that the Publick ſhould not be informed of their good chear, for fear it ſhould obſtruct the Charities beſtowed upon them. I have ſeen many times ſeveral Spits full of excellent Meat a roaſting for them, with all ſorts of Fowl, wild and tame, and great Joynts of the beſt Meat in By-houſes a little remote from their Monaſtries; and the People who lived moſtly by that Trade, told us, that all that was Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to the good Fathers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Popiſh Clergy do not Marry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Church-men do for the moſt part, and therefore help to people the Land.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Half of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates in the Kingdom is in their hands, that is to ſay, in <hi>Mortemain,</hi> which is far leſs advantagious, than if they were in the hands of People fit either for Trade, Manufactures, or Arts, or if thoſe Eſtates did paſs hereditarily by Succeſſion from Parents to Children, or to the next a-kin, and by conſequence is deſtructive to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and Welfare of a Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their miſchievous Cuſtom of keeping always abundance of Plate in their Churches and Convents, and in thoſe Treaſures, as they call them, as at S. <hi>Denis, Notre Dame de Lieſſe, Notre Dame des Ardillieres,</hi> and ſeveral other ſuch Places; I ſay that fooliſh Cuſtom deprives
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60783:53"/> the State and the People of a conſiderable part of the Gold and Silver which is in the Nation, and would be uſeful for Trade.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is alſo the uſual method of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Secular and Regular Clergy, to hoard up Money; for tho' they have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Legitimate at leaſt, and are not allowed to Trade, and withal enjoy great Revenues, yet 'tis their uſual cuſtom to Treaſure up Money, and commonly under the ſame pretence, as that the Popes have, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſiſt their Nephews and Nieces, which they ſeldom do, but when they are a dying, which is doubly prejudicial to Trade; 'Tis obſerved alſo that this ſort of Men is very covetous, and do not love to give Almes, tho' obliged to it by their firſt Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the intention of the Founders. I need not ſay any thing how prejudicial ſuch practices are to Trade, and conſequently to the Proſperity of a Nation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The great number of ridiculous Holy-days which they obſerve in <hi>France,</hi> rob that Nation of the 6th part of the working days in the year, ſince they have above 50 Holy-days more than we have in <hi>England,</hi> which is of very great conſequence to a Nation; for if ſo be the Profits of Labour and Induſtry both of Men and Women, go almoſt twice as far as all the Revenues both of Real and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal-Eſtates, let any Man judge what may be the loſs of the ſixth part of thoſe Profits: This is alſo ſo much the more ruinous to the

A great many loſe their time alſo in carrying their Maſſ-God about to the Sick and elſewhere, for there muſt be 4 Men to carry the Canopy, beſides the Prieſt, who holds the pretended Sacrament in his hands, and that is performed ſometimes in 50 differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent places at once, in the great Cities, every day, beſides many other ſuch vain ways of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60783:54"/> trifling away their precious time about ſuch fooleries: Without mentioning the Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and Rogueries that are committed on ſo many Holy-days.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Pope to whom all the Popiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Tributaries, and a kind of Slaves, and their Princes his Vaſſals, and a ſort of Subjects, does alſo rob the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> of ſeveral Millions of Livers every Year under divers Pretences and Names, as the Annates, Bulls, Diſpenſations, Indulgences, Reliques, Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and conſecrated Grains, and ſeveral other ſuch Names, which is ſo much the more ridiculous for <hi>France</hi> to endure it, that the Nation in theſe laſt Ages has had no greater Enemies than the Popes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Penſions paid yearly at <hi>Rome</hi> to the Cardinals Protectors of <hi>France,</hi> as they love to be called, and to ſeveral other ſuch men, who poſſeſs great Church-Livings in <hi>France,</hi> which they ſpend at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Knights of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> draw vaſt Sums every year out of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> from all which miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices <hi>England</hi> hath been delivered ſince the Reformation.</p>
               <p n="11">11. There was ſpent needleſly in <hi>France,</hi> about two Millions of Livers every year in Tapers and Wax-Candles burnt in their Churches, before their Statues, Images, Hoſtie, and in their Funeral Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which Wax a great part was imported from Foreign Countries, and the other part, which was the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60783:54"/> product of <hi>France,</hi> might have been ſold and imployed to better uſes, without mentioning the Oyl, which was alſo burnt on the ſame occaſion, or the time ſpent in making ſuch Wax-Lights. One can hardly imagine the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Expence that was made about theſe things in great and rich Towns. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it is much leſſened at preſent by reaſon of the great Miſery of the Kingdom, and I do not think it amounts now to the third part of what it did formerly: However, this thing contributing towards the Ruine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was alſo an obſtruction to Propagation.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Their Lent and other pretended Faſt-days, as they call them,<note place="margin">They are not called Fiſh-days, as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe Fiſh is very ſcarce in the moſt parts of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> does alſo a great prejudice to the Kingdom, ſeeing they ſpent ſome years ago, when the Kingdom was more populous and rich, above ſix Millions of Livers every year, in dry and ſalt Fiſh, which they bought from Foreign Countries, beſides what they themſelves took. This Cuſtom was alſo very prejudicial to the Breeding of Cattle, of which much leſs was conſumed than would have been otherwiſe, and conſequently it did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Revenue of Lands, and does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly occaſion the death of a great many people, with whoſe Conſtitution Fiſh does not agree, and who either cannot find Meat in the ſmall Towns and Boroughs in <hi>Lent,</hi> have no Money to buy it, or elſe entertain ſcruples
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60783:55"/> againſt it by the ſuggeſtion of the Idolatrous Prieſts, who flatter them with hopes of going directly to Heaven without paſſing thro' Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, if they abſtain from Meat at ſuch times. This did alſo deſtroy the Fiſh of the Rivers in Countries remote from the Sea, ſo as they cannot be furniſhed again, which is a great loſs to the Nation; for Sea-Fiſh being there very ſcarce and dear, the Prieſts and Monks, and ſome People in Towns and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, eat ſcarce any other but Freſh-water Fiſh: They do alſo loſe their time in Fiſhing, and very often catch nothing at all.</p>
               <p>And being upon this Subject, it may not be perhaps unſeaſonable, to confute the Errour of thoſe who fancy that <hi>Lent,</hi> and pretended Faſt-days are advantagious to a Nation; becauſe, ſay they, it ſaves abundance of Cattle, and puts people upon Fiſhing, and conſequently to the getting of more profit by the Sea, than they would otherwiſe do; and by that ſame means alſo, more Sea-men are bred. I confeſs that <hi>Lent</hi> and Faſt-days are very uſeful to ſome Nations, but 'tis not by obſerving them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by furniſhing thoſe who do ſo with Fiſh, as the Engliſh, Scotch, Dutch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who furniſh the French and others. In <hi>England</hi> the Engliſh were quickly ſenſible that this was a miſtake in Politicks; for after <hi>Lent</hi> hath been obſerved there a while, ſince the Reformation, on pretence of ſome ſuch Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reaſons, as the encouragement of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60783:55"/> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſoon left it off, perceiving it did more hurt than good; they ſaw it did not increaſe the number of Sea-men, but rather diminiſh them, and that there was no more Fiſh taken and conſumed, but rather leſs, by reaſon that People being under that ſervitude, were diſguſted with it and did eat it againſt their will upon the very Fiſh-days, and could not endure it at all at other times. Whereas they eat it at all times indifferently now, and there is always good ſtore of all ſorts to be found at the Fiſh-mongers, as well of Sea, as of Freſh-water Fiſh, and all ſorts of Shell-fiſh; and now thoſe who love Fiſh more than Meat, can pleaſe themſelves, which they could not do, if they were commanded tyrannically to do it. Beſides, Fiſher-men could not then make their conſtant Trade of Fiſhing, but only in <hi>Lent,</hi> and about <hi>Fridays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they can fiſh now, and do fiſh actually eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. 'Tis true, <hi>France</hi> does not afford ſuch plenty of Meat as <hi>England;</hi> but this muſt be alſo granted, that the People in <hi>France,</hi> who have Means, do not feed ſo much upon Meat, even upon Fleſh-days, as they call them, as the Engliſh commonly do; and beſides, the moſt part of the French People have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to do it. But I ſay further, that <hi>France</hi> is in greater want of Fiſh than of Fleſh, and that the Kingdom would have had Meat enough, if <hi>Lent,</hi> the four Ember-weeks, and other Faſt-days, had not been ſet up by Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60783:56"/> for this occaſioned a neglect in breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cattle, and even at preſent tho' the Kingdom lies deſolate in moſt parts, they could afford Cattle enough, if <hi>Lent</hi> were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and Lands not abandoned; and tho' <hi>France</hi> is at leſs Expence now, as to the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Foreign Fiſh, than it was before the War, yet it expends ſtill very great Sums that way, tho' the poorer ſort of People in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Provinces from Sea, ſeldom taſt Fiſh of any ſort, and even very rarely of Meat. But, leſt any body ſhould imagine that I contradict my ſelf, in ſaying, that the People of <hi>England</hi> does not eat leſs Fiſh ſince the obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> but do rather eat more, and that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nevertheleſs, that the obſervation of ſuch a Superſtition, prejudices the Revenues of Land in <hi>France,</hi> and hinders the breeding and conſumption of Cattle; I ſhall anſwer that ſpecious Objection: I call it ſpecious, becauſe it ſeems, that if ſo be the aboliſhing of <hi>Lent,</hi> and other Fiſh-days in <hi>England,</hi> produces that effect, that more Fiſh is eaten in it ſince, it would ſeem to follow, that leſs Meat ſhould be conſumed; and ſo conſequently, if <hi>Lent</hi> and other pretended Faſt-days were aboliſhed in <hi>France,</hi> more Fiſh would be eaten, and leſs Fleſh deſtroyed. I anſwer to this, That there is no real contradiction in my Poſition, but only a ſeeming one, and that only to thoſe who do not weigh things rightly. My reaſon is this, that in <hi>England</hi> the People have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60783:56"/> and at all ſeaſons, plenty both of Meat and Fiſh, no place in the Kingdom being very remote from Sea, and there being many Rivers full of Freſh-water Fiſh, and the Tide coming up a great way in many of thoſe Rivers, the Sea-Fiſh is convey'd into the Country at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall charge. They have alſo plenty of good Cattle; ſo that they may at all times eat that which they like beſt, or find cheapeſt, and eat it alſo without that averſion, which the Tyranny of Impoſition occaſions, when they are commanded or forbidden upon pain of Eternal Damnation to eat, or not to eat ſuch and ſuch things, at ſuch and ſuch times. Whereas <hi>France</hi> is generally much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Sea, and Fiſh there very ſcarce or dear. Now in the places far diſtant from Sea, if it were not for the Superſtition of <hi>Lent,</hi> and other Faſt-days, as they call them, in thoſe places, I ſay, they would eat much more Meat than they do, and more alſo than is eaten near the Sea-Coaſts, where Fiſh is more plentiful and cheaper, and conſequently they ſhould breed more Cattle; and likewiſe they ſhould eat more Fiſh in the Sea-ports and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places near the Sea than they do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if it were not for the Tyranny impoſed upon their Conſcience, which forbids them to eat Meat at ſuch and ſuch times, which creates if not in all, in moſt part of them a kind of abhorrency for Fiſh which they are forced to eat; And ſo it comes to paſs that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60783:57"/> leſs Fiſh is taken in the Sea-ports, than there would be without this Superſtition; and alſo leſs Cattle is bred in the Country than there would be, if it were not for the ſame abuſe, which forbids the eating of Meat for about five Months in the Year, and ſo puts all things in diſorder. For by this means thoſe that live near the Sea are diſguſted at Fiſh, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Providence affords them very cheap, and almoſt for nothing, and which would be a great Treaſure to them, if it were not for the Tyranny impoſed upon them, and thoſe that live in the Country farther off, who could breed abundance of Cattle, and eat Meat very cheap, are forced to abſtain from it, and loſe that great advantage, and cannot have Fiſh but at a very dear rate. This horrid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe occaſioned formerly the Expenſe of a great many Millions Yearly to <hi>France</hi> for Foreign Fiſh, and cauſes a vaſt expenſe even at preſent, but does 6 times more prejudice otherwiſe, beſides the Diſeaſes and Death of abundance of weakly or old People, with whoſe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution Fiſh does not agree, as I ſaid already, and are therefore forced to eat many unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom things unfit for them, by reaſon of their ſcruples of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Things ſtand in their natural Order in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as to this, whereas in <hi>France</hi> all is turn'd upſide down; For why, humanly and chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly ſpeaking, ſhall it be lawful to eat Meat at ſuch times rather than at others? Or why
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60783:57"/> muſt the Country-people be obliged to throw to the Dogs their Calves and Kids that are brought forth about <hi>Lent,</hi> when they want the Milk of the Dam? Becauſe no body is free to buy and eat Fleſh at that time.</p>
               <p>Obſerve by the way, that <hi>France</hi> has loſt alſo conſiderably in that reſpect, by the expulſion of Proteſtants, becauſe they did buy at that time ſuch Young Beaſts and ſeveral others in the Countries where they did live, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had been loſt to the Owners, or elſe very chargeable to them. This may ſeem to be an inconſiderable thing, but yet 'tis not ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in ſuch a great Kingdom as <hi>France</hi> is, where it occaſions the loſs of great Sums Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But here are yet two other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of great moment which happen by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Lent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is, That the People are obliged very often to keep abundance of Cattle almoſt two Months longer than they would, or can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently do, for want of Forage or other Food, which occaſions oftentimes the loſs of a great many Cattle and Beaſts. It is known that the Country-people uſe to keep every Year a certain fixt number of Beaſts of all kinds; Now it comes very often to paſs, that ſome years Forage and Food is ſcarcer than others, that the Winter is ſharper and longer; ſo that the Farmers and Peaſants being ill-provided with Forage in thoſe years, and there being little Graſs yet growing in the Fields, becauſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60783:58"/> of the backwardneſs of the Seaſon, their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle muſt needs ſuffer much, if not periſh quite, which would not happen if there was no ſuch thing as <hi>Lent;</hi> for in that caſe they would ſell part of their Cattle to Butchers, or eat it themſelves.</p>
               <p>The ſecond inconvenience which I obſerved is this, that in <hi>Lent</hi> and other Faſt-days, the richeſt Peaſants who dare not eat Meat then, &amp; who have no Fiſh, do eat the moſt part of the Milk of their Cows, which diſables them to ſuckle their Calves well, which is partly the cauſe why the <hi>French</hi> Cattle are commonly ſo poor and ſmall. So that by this means, the Boors by not eating Fleſh in <hi>Lent,</hi> deſtroy four times more Fleſh than they would do if they were allowed to eat it; which is alſo a vaſt prejudice to <hi>Agriculture,</hi> the Revenue of a State, and to the Propagation of Mankind. If any bold pretenders, to wit contemn thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, as if they were more proper for Boors, than for intelligent and refined Men; I cannot help it, but I believe all Men will not be of their Opinion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That Spirit of Unjuſtice and Violence which at all times poſſeſſeth the Romiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and ſets them when ever they meet with Princes of their own humour, to perſecute thoſe with the utmoſt fury, who will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Opinions, which have no other foundation, but their own Ambition, Pride and Covetouſneſs; that Spirit, I ſay, of Unjuſtice
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60783:58"/> has been one of the great cauſes of the Ruine of <hi>France.</hi> I leave it to the World to judge, whether they have not taken advantage in theſe laſt times of the weakneſs of that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Prince, who was poſſeſſed with the Chimerical Deſign of an Univerſal Monarchy, to make him believe that it was convenient for him, in order to attain his End, to deſtroy the reformed Religion in <hi>England, Holland, France,</hi> and in all other parts, and under that pretence to bring King <hi>James,</hi> who was known to be a bigotted Prince into the ſame deſign, and oblige him to do all what we know he did, and to diſpoſſeſs him at laſt, and keep <hi>Great Brittain</hi> for himſelf; I appeal, I ſay, to the Judicious, whether we may not ſay with reaſon, that in this reſpect the <hi>Romiſh Clergy</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have been the Incendiaries of this War, which is like to ruine the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> for ever, or if that be not granted, yet they muſt of neceſſity own that their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Spirit has done incredible miſchiefs to that Nation.</p>
               <p n="14">14. There is yet another thing very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the welfare of the Nation, and to the Propagation of the People, <hi>viz</hi> that the <hi>French Clergy,</hi> who enjoy the half of all the Eſtates Real and Perſonal, of the Kingdom, as I have already ſaid, and ought conſequently to pay at leaſt as much to the King proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably, as the other Subjects, who poſſeſs the other half of the Kingdom. The Clergy, I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60783:59"/> ſay, pay, even at preſent, ſcarce ten Millions of Livers ſince the War, to wards the 200 Millions which the King exacts every year, one way or other, from the Nation, that is to ſay, that the Clergy and Religious Orders, both Male and Female, who make up perhaps 300 thouſand Souls, enjoy as much Revenue as 8 or 9 Millions of other People that are yet in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> at this day, or as much as was enjoyed by 13 or 14 Millions that might have been in it 30 years ago, and that altho' every one of the Clergy and Religious Orders, one with another, hath as much to ſpend now, in relation to the Revenue of the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, as 40 or 50 other Perſons of the promiſcuous multitude, taken one with another, that yet for all that, the Clergy and Religious Orders taken in bulk, do not bear above the 20th part of the charges of the Government. And this muſt be yet added, that before this War, when the King did raiſe by the ordinary Impoſitions 132 Millions Yearly, without the Caſualties, as they call it, that did amount ſome Years to 50, 60 and 70 Millions, the Clergy did not pay above 5 or 6 Millions Yearly. For the Poll-Tax, by which they are obliged to pay 4 Millions Yearly during 5 Years, was eſtabliſhed ſince. But further, that we may better comprehend how much the Clergy is eaſed above all other Subjects in the Kingdom, it muſt be known that the Officers of Judicature and other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60783:59"/> Officers in the Nation, as thoſe of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Civil-Government, and others, who did all of them buy their Offices very dear, the Farmers of the Impoſts, great and ſmall, with all their Crew, and the Clergy themſelves, did coſt the People altogether above 200 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers Yearly, when the Kingdom was in a better condition than now, that is, about 20 or 30 years ago, without mentioning other Vexations and the loſs of their time which they ſuffered, by continual wranglings at Law, Oppreſſions and Depradations of their Goods, or by the Superſtitions of the Clergy; of all which Vexations and Loſſes of time, and other Calamities, if they had been free, they might have probably earned or ſaved 100 Millions <hi>per Annum</hi> more. But theſe things, I ſay, I don't reckon, becauſe they turned to no body's account. At preſent indeed they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get ſo much from the People, becauſe of their being deſtroyed and totally ruined. Now the Clergy is not only free from all thoſe Miſchiefs and Loſſes of Money and Time, to which the other Subjects are obnoxious, but they do alſo get Money from the People and plunder them by their falſe Devotions, and a thouſand new ways contrived by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, abuſing the Peoples credulity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring continually to involue them in greater Ignorance, that they might domineer over them more eaſily, and ſo diſpoil them. 'Tis very well known, that the Officers of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60783:60"/> do much more indulge the Clergy than they do the other Subjects, and that the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Impoſitions have little or nothing to do with them; and notwithſtanding that the Clergy do abuſe and cheat them of their Subſtance by their ſuperſtitious tricks, as well as they do other People; yet they are reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and feared by the Lawyers, and do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome Judges, Advocates and Atturneys, who are their Penſionaries; There is not one Community of Eccleſiaſticks or Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, either Male or Female, but have ſome Penſionaries in all the notable Tribunals where their buſineſſes lye, who order it ſo that they gain almoſt all their Suits at Law, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſoever they be, againſt the Laity, who are leſs able to ſuſtain a good cauſe, for want of Money and Protection, and then the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks are every day forging falſe Titles for want of good ones, by the hand of a Father <hi>Titrier,</hi> as they call him, that is, a Maker or Keeper of their Titles; for 'tis certain, that they have ſuch a one in all the Communalties of Eccleſiaſticks. This goes under the name of pious Frauds, as well as the falſe Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Legacies which they often pretend to have been beſtowed upon them. In that manner they diſpoil the poor Laymen of their Eſtates, by the Favour and Protection they find one from another, for they ſupport one another as Thieves do, and are ſupported by the Pope, who has a ſecret influence upon all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60783:60"/> their Affairs, and ſometimes they are ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo by Courtiers; beſides the advantage they have by being richer than their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and by bribing the Officers of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who ſometimes, as I ſaid, are their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries. As for the <hi>Maltotiers,</hi> that is, the Farmers general and particular of Impoſitions, and their Servants, the Romiſh Clergy is not expoſed to their Robberies, for they are not obnoxious to the Publick Taxes, but contrary-wiſe, thoſe men are much more obnoxious to the Craft of the Clergy, for they flatter them with the hopes of a Pardon for all their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſions and Robberies, if they do but employ them about ſaying Maſſes, or make them Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, or enter into their Fraternities, and pay for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither are they expoſed as others are, to the vexations committed in raiſing of Publick Taxes; for, as I ſaid already, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Taxes do not regard them: Nor do they ſuffer by the Subtilties and Cheating Tricks of other Eccleſiaſticks, as do the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for one Raven does never pick out the Eyes of another. And moreover, their Eſtates, and their Farmers and Tenants, are in a better condition than thoſe of others, becauſe the Landlords, being well in their Affairs, are able to ſupport them the better, and their Houſes and Lands are always kept in better order, and furniſhed with the beſt Cattle the Land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords. Beſides, they are not liable to be forced to buy new Offices, or loſe the old ones, as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60783:61"/> other people are, becauſe they have none. They are not cruſhed as the other Subjects, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary Taxes, nor with forced Loans to the King, whereby ſo many thouſands of others have been and are every day utterly ruined; neither do they go to War, nor to the Arrier-Ban. By this means, it comes to paſs, that this ſort of People, who are for the moſt part burthenſom and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Nation, and even to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Church, are free from all the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under which the uſeful Subjects groan. I ſay, they are unprofitable for the moſt part; for 'tis certainly true, that tho' of 250 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand People of that kind, there may be in that Kingdom (beſides the Nuns) 190 thouſand ſhould be disbanded, there would remain a ſufficient number for their ordinary Service. And ſo all the Monks generally, either thoſe that enjoy great Rents, or thoſe who are Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, might be very conveniently diſmiſſed, and generally all the Convents might be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, maintaining only the Biſhops and a competent number of Curates and Prieſts, who ought to pay Taxes proportionably to their Revenues. Equity, good Order, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Welfare requires no leſs. But nothing good was to be expected from ſuch a Reign as this is. I grant the Curats and Country-Prieſts are heavily loaden with Taxes, and that they can hardly ſubſiſt, becauſe all the burthen is caſt upon them; But yet they fare a great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60783:61"/> deal better than the greateſt part of the Laity, who poſſeſſed formerly ſome Eſtates, which they have loſt now by the Taxes, and are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all charged with Debts and Children. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as tho' the Prieſts be never ſo poor, yet ſome Bread is left them, without any toil or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil for it; for they neither labour nor preach, nor are bound to do any kind of work, but what the moſt idle, ſtupid and ignorant Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant might do as well, if he could but read, and had memory enough to learn by long practice, how to handle the Muſquet and ſome part of the Military Poſtures, for the exerciſe of the Maſs and Prieſts Trade, may be learnt and practiſed as eaſily as that; they enjoy a Church-living <hi>gratis,</hi> which they neither merit for their capacity nor ſervices, which are none, neither had by Inheritance from their Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, nor can be ſeized upon for Debts. I grant, 'tis but reaſon they ſhould live by their Trade, ſince they do that which the People will have them to do, and wherewith they are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But as for thoſe numbers of rich Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſteries, Convents, Commonalties, Abbeys, Priorys, Prebendaries which contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or almoſt nothing, to the ſupport of the Government: What reaſon is there that they ſhould enjoy the half of all the Eſtates in the Kingdom, and ſhould not pay to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, above the 20th part of what the reſt of the Nation pays. For, as I ſaid before, thoſe wealthy Clergy-men pay almoſt nothing of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60783:62"/> what the Clergy pays in general; All the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then falls upon the little Curates and Prieſts, who are left without Protection, though they ought to be moſt protected of all. I confeſs indeed, that as for the Laity, the Revenues and Profits of their Induſtry, help them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the paying of Taxes, whereas the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy has no ſuch help. But for all that, the Laity is overwhelmed with Taxes, while the Clergy thrives and fares well. Moreover, what Juſtice is it that the diligent and laborious ſort of People in a Nation ſhould periſh, and be deſtroyed like Victims, in order to fatten the lazy and idle ſort, and that ſo many Millions of uſeful Subjects, ſhould be Sacrificed to ſuch ſluggiſh Belly-Gods? We can never enough bewail ſuch a blindneſs as this, nor expreſs all the miſchiefs which ſuch an Unjuſtice brings along with it, and wherewith <hi>France</hi> hath been afflicted for ſo many Centuries, the effects which are more pernicions now than ever.</p>
               <p n="15">15. What ſhall we ſay of the Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of that pretended Religion, ſo ſuitable to its Doctrines, which is commonly aſcribed to the Jeſuites, but belongs <hi>de faclo</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> to all the Sects, and Parts of the Popery and is authorized by the conſtant practice of all their pretended Church? Which canonizes all the Crimes perpetrated for its intereſt, and palliates and extenuates all others, has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed the Ten Commandments of God's Law by other Laws diametrically oppoſite and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60783:62"/> contrary to them, and conſtantly practiſed and commanded by that Society of Men, commonly called the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Room,</hi> as I could eaſily juſtifie, which fills the whole World, but <hi>France</hi> eſpecially, with Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all ſorts of Vices.</p>
               <p n="16">16. What ſhall we ſay more of that Spirit of Tyranny, with which the Romiſh Clergy, but eſpecially the Jeſuits, do inſpire Princes who are ruled by them, not only in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Religion, but alſo to Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by counſelling 'em to make uſe of the moſt deſperate Tyranny, becauſe that how much the more the Princes whom they govern, are authorized and feared of their Subjects, ſo much the more are the Jeſuits their Tutors authorized and dreaded alſo. <hi>France</hi> ſmarts at preſent under the effects of this, and <hi>England</hi> has but lately eſcaped the like danger. That Spirit of Tyranny which makes up a great part of the Eſſence of Popery, is yet more peculiar to the Society of Jeſuits, than to any other in Popery. And 'tis known that the Principles of their Order, as they call it, do give their General an abſolute and indefinite Power to Command, and to do what he liſts, and that they are to render him a Blindfold-obedience, and they look upon the Pope's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Monarchy over the Univerſal Church and World, to be the moſt perfect Pattern of Governments, in aſſuming to himſelf the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to deſtroy all Nations and Perſons in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60783:63"/> Soul and Body, who oppoſe his temporal Interſte.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Unchaſtity of all their Clergy both Male and Female, cauſed by their Celibacy, and execrable Morals, as well as by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all the chiefeſt Prelates at <hi>Rome,</hi> is of a very great prejudice to <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it did formerly fill the whole Kingdom with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, Fornications, Inceſtuous Copulations, and things yet more execrable, nay, with mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of open and hidden Crimes, and cauſes ſtill abundance of ſuch Diſorders, as an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Abortions, Murtherings of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſuch like; for the Clergy who are guilty of thoſe Vices, make no ſcruple, ſo they can but conceal them, to murther both the Mothers and Children. And then beſides, they corrupt People by their ill Examples, auricular Confeſſions, and the pretended Power they have to give Abſolution for all ſuch Vices: theſe things with the Morals of their Caſuiſts has done horrid Effects in <hi>France,</hi> and does ſtill deſtroy many thouſands of People every year, keeps abundance of People from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, is a great obſtruction to Propagation, and is very contrary to the Publick good.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The Drunkenneſs of that Clergy had alſo formerly, and has ſtill (tho' not ſo much now becauſe of the Extream Miſery) a very great influence upon the Manners of all the Nation. For the greateſt part of the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, except ſeveral Biſhops and Curates in the biggeſt Towns, and ſome other Men in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60783:63"/> Monaſteries and Commonalties, are Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and upon their example many of the Common-people are ſuch alſo; and it muſt be confeſſed that beſides the loſs of ſo great a quantity of Wine, unprofitably ſpent by that Clergy, and upon their example by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is a very great loſs; Drunkenneſs, as well as Whoredom, ruines abundance of Families and deſtroys many People, ſhortning their days, and cauſing them to loſe all their time.</p>
               <p>I leave to Divines to ſpeak of the bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thoſe Vices as to the Eternal Salvation. It were to no purpoſe to ſay that Drunkenneſs, Adultery and Fornication are common alſo to other Nations, but Papiſts. For 'tis the Popiſh Church, that hath moſt of all infected all the Word, and therefore ſhe is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called in Scripture, <hi>The Mother of all the Fornications and Abominations of all the Earth;</hi> for ſhe practiſes, abets and countenances them. And beſides that, it is certain that the Popiſh Clergy, and even in general all People in the World, who are ignorant in the Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and hate the Holy Scripture, or do not read it, and have plenty of all things, as that Clergy who have nothing to do, for there is not one in two hundred that Preaches or Studies, that have no Legitimate Children or any care of Family, that by their Sacred Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes muſt above all things be well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Tools fit for Generation, and to have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60783:64"/> no Averſion from Wine. 'Tis certain, I ſay, that People who are in all thoſe Circumſtances as the Popiſh Clergy is, commonly are Reprobates, and given to all Crimes and Vices. How much the more that Clergy who are not obnoxious to the Secular Juſtice, and fear no repreſſion, who are awed and reſpected generally by the People (tho' never ſo impious and profane) as making their own God, and pardoning Sins <hi>authoritative</hi> to whom they pleaſe, and upon whoſe intention the making of all Sacraments depends; Such Clergy, I ſay, who do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to themſelves any other Examples of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue but that of the Popes and Cardinals, whoſe Ambition, Pride, Perfidiouſneſs, Cruelty, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and Covetouſneſs are ſo well known, and yet if we'll believe them, they can ſave and damn all Men and Nations as they pleaſe. It's certainly eaſie enough to conceive that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can hardly thrive ſo well under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſuch Men, and ſuch a ſtrange ſort of Religion, which is truly Antichriſtian, as under the Reformed Religion, and a Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Miniſtry. In a word, it may be truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed without any paſſion or invective, that the Popiſh Morals and the conſtant practice of their pretended Church do authorize, even by their Councils and approved Doctors, all Crimes and Vices, which has a powerful and mighty influence upon the manners of the People, and by this means, if God had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Secular Juſtice to be depraved to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60783:64"/> ſuch a degree as the Principles and Practices of that Church are, humane Society ſhould never have ſubſiſted. So that we have but very little reaſon to admire the great Wiſdom or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Politicks of thoſe great Men, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <hi>de Richelien</hi> and <hi>Mazarin, Louvois, Colbert</hi> and others, who did not perceive thoſe palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and groſs abuſes, or which is worſe, had no inclination to Reform them. If any Man ſay, that the reſpect they had for Religion did hinder them, that's a mighty reflection upon their underſtanding, for how could they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the Chriſtian Religion and its great Author, ſuch follies and extravagancies, which are not attended with the leaſt Profit, and are ſo much againſt common ſenſe, ſo ſcandalous and contrary to equity and charity, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding viſibly to the ruine of States and Nations. Beſides, 'tis well known, that thoſe Perſons cared but little for Religion, and that they did not regulate themſelves by a ſuperſtitious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottery, nor was it the difficulty of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch extraordinary abuſes, that did deterr them from it, for the thing was eaſie to be done, eſpecially under a Prince of ſo much Authority as <hi>Lewis.</hi> the XIV. and all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have been glad of it, becauſe it would have eaſed them conſiderably, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's plain, it was for no other reaſon, but that they wanted a due elevation of mind, and zeal for the Publick good. Nothing was dear to them, but their own Intereſt, and how
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60783:65"/> they might ſatisfie their Ambition and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and attain their deſire to enrich and raiſe their Families.</p>
               <p>This is ſome part of the Political Miſchiefs that the Romiſh Religion is the cauſe of; and every Body may learn from hence, that all the Popiſh States, who are not inclined to ſhake off the Pope's Yoke, think it their Intereſt to endea your to reduce thoſe who ſhook it off under the ſame again, to deprive them of thoſe great advantages they enjoy above themſelves, and therefore Proteſtant States ought to be at all times upon their Guard, as well to preſerve their Religion as their Civil Government. I make bold to ſay, that I could demonſtrate here, if it were convenient, that the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath cauſed a prejudice to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> of above 200 Millions of Livers one year with another, for a long time.</p>
               <p>Certainly any man will be convinced, that the Doctrines of the Pope's Supremacy and Tranſubſtantiation, and ſome other of the ſame ſort, make but a ſmall compenſation to <hi>France</hi> for the great Loſſes ſhe endures by them, and that if ſo be there had been any true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of Judgment, or any ſpark of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity in thoſe great Politicians before named, they would have avoided ſuch a ruine, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves to acknowledge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt and his Word, without charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with ſuch ruinous and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60783:65"/> Opinions. One would think that Men who have ſo little regard to reaſons drawn from the Holy Scriptures, againſt Popery, ought to be ſo much the more affected with thoſe which Temporal Intereſt affords.</p>
               <p>So that for the Reaſons above mentioned, and others that might be named; I think the aboliſhing of Popery in <hi>England,</hi> is worth to this Kingdom at leaſt 8 Millions Sterling Yearly, which it ſpares by it one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and proportionably to <hi>Scotland,</hi> but much leſs to <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe Popery Reigns ſtill there too much, with moſt of the diſorders which I noted before.</p>
               <p>Here it is fit to obſerve, that I do not reckon amongſt the 200 Millions of Livers which <hi>France</hi> loſes every Year one with another by Popery, the ordinary Annual Revenues which the Clergy get either from the Real and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal-Eſtates, or by their Cheats and Tricks; for all that they get by thoſe things is not loſt to the Kingdom, ſeeing they muſt live. I underſtand only the damages that are cauſed by the Principles of Popery and their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequences. Nor do I mean that <hi>France</hi> loſes at preſent ſo much Yearly, as 200 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <hi>per Annum,</hi> by Popery at preſent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Kingdoms decay in its Revenues: But it may be affirmed with reaſon, that for a very long time, till the days wherein we live, it loſt above 200 Millions, or the equivalent every year one with another. This muſt be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60783:66"/> underſtood, ſince Silver and Gold became more common in <hi>France,</hi> for 200 hundred years ago, all the Revenues of <hi>France</hi> were not worth 100 Millions.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to demonſtrate, that if Popery were aboliſhed in <hi>France,</hi> which is not to be expected in this Reign, and tho' the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were as at preſent in reſpect of Taxes, yet the King of <hi>France</hi> might eaſily get an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Millions of Livers more from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. does, without the Peoples being Taxed any more than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>France</hi> is not ſo conveniently ſituated for Trade as <hi>England,</hi> which is incompaſſed almoſt round by the Sea, and has four times as many good Ports as <hi>France,</hi> and no body can deny that this is a great advantage, for to make a Nation both populous and rich.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>France</hi> has no ſuch Mines as <hi>England</hi> has, of Tin, Copper, and Lead which do inrich the Land, and furniſh Subſiſtence to an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of People, as well as the Coal-pits we have, of which none almoſt in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. The Copſe-Woods do take up great part of the ground in <hi>France,</hi> whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coal-pits take up very little ground, whence there is ſo much the more Ground for Tillage and Husbandry, which ſerves to maintain a greater quantity of People.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:60783:66"/>
               <p n="22">22. The Vines of which the Expences are ſo great, and their Revenue ſo uncertain, ſince they fail commonly more than once in three Years, take up alſo a great deal of Ground in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> whereas the Corn or ordinary Mault, wherewith we make our Drink in <hi>England,</hi> fails more ſeldom, and coſts much leſs, either for cultivating of it or get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it from other places. So that 'tis rare that the price of Beer increaſes.</p>
               <p n="23">23. 'Tis obſerved alſo, that Corn Lands in <hi>France</hi> fail oftner than in <hi>England,</hi> which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, if it be true, as I believe it is, muſt proceed either from a greater fruitfulneſs of the Soil in <hi>England,</hi> or from a more equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Air, or from this Reaſon, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are better provided with good Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Men, and all other neceſſaries for Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, or from all thoſe Reaſons together, Which I think to be very true, and is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. We have ſhewn already that the Land is more populous, and the Cattle is more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous alſo, and better fed than in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe there is generally more Hay and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſtures in <hi>England,</hi> and by conſequence their Cattle, as well as Men who are better fed, can work better; Beſides, their Cattle make more Dung and better than that of <hi>France,</hi> for the Dung of good and luſty Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is better than that of weakly and lean Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Hay-dung is better than Straw-dung;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60783:67"/>
'Tis known there is almoſt no Hay in ſeveral Provinces of <hi>France;</hi> So that the Horſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they Plow and Till the Ground, feed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Straw with ſome Oats, and for that reaſon they cannot keep Cows nor Oxen. In other Provinces where they keep ſuch Cattle, they mix Straw with Hay for their food; and as I ſaid before, the Young Calves being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived in <hi>Lent</hi> and other Faſt-days, of the Milk of the Cows, becauſe the Boors live upon Milk at thoſe times, this hinders the Cattle from growing luſty and ſtrong; But further, the extream poverty of Farmers and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-people does not permit them to do their Work ſo well as it ought to be done, nor to be ſupplied with ſuch good Cattle and other neceſſaries. However, 'tis certain, that tho' <hi>England</hi> is not ſo well peopled, nor the ground ſo well managed as it ſhould be; 'tis certain, I ſay, it ſends abundance of Corn to Foreign Nations; <hi>Holland, Flanders, Spain, Portugal</hi> have vaſt quantities from hence, which confirms it further, that <hi>England</hi> is more populous than moſt People think, eſpecially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that <hi>London</hi> conſumeth ſuch a prodigious quantity of Corn, and that commonly at a good rate, if compared with the ordinary price of it at <hi>Paris,</hi> tho' not much above half ſo big as <hi>London,</hi> and which is ſituated in the midſt of ſeveral Provinces abounding with Corn, and enjoys ſeveral Rivers fit for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which do all fall into the River <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:60783:67"/>
               <p n="24">24. A Country fit for Paſture and Breeding of Cattle, can maintain a greater number of People, than one which is deſtitute of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, becauſe the Cattle feeding in the Fields, work for Men in their abſence, and they can in the mean time go about their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Beſides, Cattle ſupplies many Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures as I ſaid before, as are thoſe of Wooll, Leather, Horns, Butter, Cheeſe, Tallow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover, a little Meat with Bread, nouriſhes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than 3 times as much Bread without Meat. That's the Reaſon why the <hi>Engliſh People</hi> eat generally leſs Bread than thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> and withal are ſtronger and fatter.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Victuals are commonly cheaper in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> which wonderfully helps to the encreaſe of People, when not occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſcarcity of Money, as 'tis now in <hi>France;</hi> 'tis mightily advantagious to Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Manufacturers, Merchants, who can Victual their Ships at a better rate than others can do, and they may by that means, as well as Tradeſmen and Manufacturers afford their Commodities cheaper to Foreigners and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ſo underſell all others.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Woollen-cloath, which is the ordinary Cloathing of Mankind, Coal-fowel, Salt, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, Common-Sope, Shoes, are cheaper in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> which is a great help to Propagation, for the leſs it coſts people to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60783:68"/> maintain themſelves and their Family, the more are they inclined to marriage.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The Fiſhing alſo in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas, and the great plenty of Oyſters, Crabs, Muſcles, Langoſts, Cockles and other ſuch things, do maintain and nouriſh many more People, both Fiſhermen and others, in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> and conſequently make it a great deal more populous.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>England</hi> has alſo ſeveral great Rivers naturally better furniſhed with Freſh-water Fiſh than thoſe of <hi>France.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Lent</hi> and other Fiſh-days, as well as great numbers of Monks who are forbidden to eat Meat at any time, have exhauſted all the Rivers of <hi>France</hi> of Fiſh, to that degree, that very few is to be found in them, as I inſinuated before, and the Rivers of <hi>England</hi> have moreover a long Tide and Ebb, ſo that the Sea-Fiſh is always at a good rate, becauſe it can be carried by that means very eaſily and cheap, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all parts of <hi>England,</hi> which is generally nearer the Sea than <hi>France</hi> is.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The ſtupendious multitude of Soldiers in the <hi>French</hi> Service, which the King keeps even in times of Peace, who are for the moſt part Unmarried, as I already ſaid, and what's worſe, do mightily vex and diſturb the other Subjects, are a great impediment to <hi>France</hi>'s being ſo populous as <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. They do not take ſo great care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60783:68"/> poor Families in <hi>France,</hi> as they do in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31. There dyes without neceſſity, that is to ſay, for meer want, much more People in Hoſpitals, and poor Families in <hi>France</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> as I have demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="32">32. The method of raiſing Taxes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. Reign, has alſo contributed much towards depopulating the Kingdom: As for example, the <hi>Taille,</hi> the <hi>Gabelle</hi> or Exciſe upon Salt, the <hi>Utenſile</hi> and ſome other Impoſitions, are raiſed by Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who are obliged <hi>in Solidum,</hi> to pay one for another and for all the Pariſh, where they are eſtabliſhed Collectors, to pay, I ſay, and anſwer for all inſolvent perſons; Such Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors have commonly no Wages nor Sallary for their pains, as they have in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that they are obliged to ſpend all their time therein, without any indemnity, and as the People is ruined, if the Collectors have any thing to loſe, they loſe it alſo infallibly; I have known ſeveral Peaſants who had 30 years ago, a Stock of five, or ſix, or ten thouſand Livers, who in two or three years time, have been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ruined, by being made Collectors. There is none of 'em at preſent in the Country, that are worth any thing, ſo that they cannot loſe it, but they are continually buſie, running from place to place in the Pariſh to get Payment, and loſe abſolutely all their time in that unlucky Office. There are at leaſt four of them for the <hi>Taille</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:60783:69"/> in every Pariſh, and four for the <hi>Gabelle</hi> or Impoſition upon Salt, every year; in ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes there are more. Moreover, the Collectors of the former years, to whom ſomething is owing of the old Taxes which they paid for other, loſe alſo their time about recovering their due, running from Houſe to Houſe; and for all this, becauſe 'tis often impoſſible to them to pay the Receivers, being not paid themſelves, they are frequently Impriſoned, and muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the Goal; it intangles them beſides, in many Suits at Law, wherein they and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries loſe Money and Time. And ſo in all other Impoſitions and Taxes, beſides what the King has for his ſhare, which is always very exceſſive, and what the Farmers general and particular, and their wretched Tools, get or extort for themſelves upon the Nation, they put the poor People to vaſt Charges by the Suits at Law, unjuſt Confiſcations, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, loſſes of Time, and many other oppreſſive Ways; So that the Vexations of the People of <hi>France</hi> are inexpreſſible. Any body may judge what damage and prejudice it cauſes to a Kingdom, if it were nothing elſe but the loſs of Time.</p>
               <p>The thing is not only ſo in relation to the Exciſe upon <hi>Salt,</hi> and that called the <hi>Taille,</hi> and ſome others, raiſed by Collectors, but alſo in relation to ſeveral hundreds of other Taxes, which are not gathered by Collectors, but by other Men Commiſſioned and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60783:69"/> therein by the general and particular Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Impoſts. One cannot imagine the Vexations and Robberies they commit upon the People, nor the incredible multitude of unjuſt Suits at Law which they raiſe, wherein they are both Judges and Parties; and the loſs of Time they cauſe, as well as of Goods, which they occaſion to the Subjects, is very conſiderable. Neither are they the only Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by it, the Officers of Judicature have alſo a ſhare in it; but as for the Time loſt, and ſeveral other diſorders and loſſes it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Nation, no body gets any thing by it. I dare ſay, that before this War the Unjuſtice and Violence of thoſe Men did beget more wranglings at Law all over the Kingdom every year, by the occaſion of Taxes alone, than there are in <hi>Spain</hi> every year, upon what Subject ſoever.</p>
               <p n="33">33. <hi>England</hi> enjoys yet another advantage over <hi>France,</hi> which is this, that the Air is more temperate, being neither ſo cold nor ſo hot, as 'tis in the coldeſt or hotteſt parts of <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of the Vapours of the Sea, which allay the ſeverity of the cold and the heat of the Sun, which makes <hi>England</hi> to be fitter for Propagation and Multiplication both of Men and Cattle, and from thence it is that 'tis ſo plentiful in Cattle, and all ſorts of Graſs, Roots, and Herbs.</p>
               <p n="34">34. As for its Situation, beſides that it is compaſſed almoſt round by the Sea, which makes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60783:70"/> her in ſome ſort a Neighbour to all the parts of the Univerſal World, by means of Navigation and Trade; It has theſe further advantages over <hi>France,</hi> that its Sea-ports are far better, and more in number as I inſinuated elſewhere, and that it may be ſaid with truth, that it is much nearer the moſt trading parts of Europe, and even of the whole World; ſince on the Eaſt it faces <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the moſt trading parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> And on the North and Eaſt. it is nearer the Countries, from whence all Materials neceſſary for Navigation and Shipping are to be gotten <hi>viz. Norwegive, Denmark, Swede, Poland, Pruſſia, Liefland,</hi> and the moſt Northern parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> On the South, it faces the beſt and moſt trading part of <hi>France;</hi> and as for the reſt of the World, the great number of its Ships, and the good Convoys it furniſhes them with, ſets it, as I have ſaid already, in the Neighbourhood of the remoteſt parts of the World.</p>
               <p n="35">35. We muſt not forget another great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that <hi>England</hi> has above <hi>France, viz,</hi> that, by its ſituation, which has procured to it the <hi>Naval Power</hi> it enjoys, <hi>England</hi> cannot be eaſily invaded by Neighbouring Nations, as we ſee it commonly practiſed amongſt other Nations that are contiguous one to another, and as we have ſeen lately the <hi>French</hi> King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading <hi>Spain, Germany, Flanders, Savoy,</hi> &amp;c. which has occaſioned the ruine and depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of part of thoſe Countries, as did alſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60783:70"/> formerly the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and other Neighbours when they invaded <hi>France.</hi> So that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> is more free from that danger and diſhonour than any other People whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p n="36">36. We ought alſo to reckon this to be a great advantage that <hi>England</hi> has above <hi>France</hi> and other Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> that by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea between <hi>England</hi> and them, we are not ſo much in danger of being tempted to invade other Nations, which ſaves <hi>England</hi> abundance of precious Blood; whereas <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of its ſituation, ſheds floods of her People's Blood at random and in vain, which has brought that unhappy Kindgom into the miſerable condition it is in at preſent. For tho' the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maritime Forces do put them in a condition to enterprize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Neighbouring Nations, and to land Armies in their Country, as it is well known they often did formerly, having almoſt conquered all that great Kingdom, inſomuch that ſome of our Kings were Crowned Kings of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> altho', I ſay, this Nation be more able than ever it was, (eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a King ſo Wiſe and Valliant as the preſent King) to enterprize things of that Nature, if it were thought fit; yet it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that there is much more difficulty in tranſporting into an Enemies Country great Armies with many Horſes, and all other Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page by Sea than by Land, eſpecially having
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60783:71"/> no Sea-port nor place belonging to us in the Land that is to be attacked, ſince a handful of Men ſtanding upon their guard, can hinder their Landing, or at leaſt the taking of footing there, and that we are to depend continually upon the <hi>Capricio</hi> of that unconſtant and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Element, and ſeeing one Storm can fruſtrate all our Deſigns; We cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that, in the courſe of one Age, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious ſituation of <hi>England</hi> does ſave us, yet in that one reſpect many thouſand People; Had <hi>France</hi> been in ſuch circumſtances as to that point, ſhe might have ſpared many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Subjects.</p>
               <p n="37">37. For this ſame Reaſon we are leſs obliged than other Nations are, to be concerned in the quarrels that the Countries contiguous one to another, are liable to in the main Land, unleſs they have or may have, ſome influence upon our Trade, and may enable any of our Neighbours to diſpute us by degrees, out of the Dominion of the Sea, or to do us any miſchief by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Naval Power; it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, how many People this thing does alſo ſave to <hi>England.</hi> And beſides, we are in a greater capacity to croſs and diſappoint the deſigns of ſeveral potent Nations, than they are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint ours. I mean by the ſtrength and nimbleneſs of our Naval Forces, which can keep them always in allarm, and oblige them to guard all their Maritime Places and Coaſts with Soldiers, which is very chargeable to 'em.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:60783:71"/>
               <p n="38">38. By all theſe reaſons it appears alſo, that there is no neceſſity for us to keep on foot ſuch vaſt numbers of Forces in time of Peace, as our Neighbours are obliged to do, becauſe there is not commonly much reaſon to fear their Invaſions, when <hi>England</hi> is well united in it ſelf. I confeſs, there is always need of a good Fleet, but it's leſs coſt and trouble to the Nation than one or two hundred thouſand Men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides is very uſeful to our Trade. Add to this, that other Nations are not free neither, notwithſtanding the great number of their ſtanding Forces, from the neceſſity of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining either great or ſmall Fleets, as well as <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39. The Places and Towns which the <hi>French</hi> King has kept ſo long in the Dominions of other Princes and States, did drain away the Coin from <hi>France,</hi> beſides ſeveral thouſands of Families. As for example, <hi>Cazal</hi> and <hi>Pignerol,</hi> where great Garriſons were kept, and all their Proviſions were bought from <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> with <hi>French</hi> Money. Thoſe 2 places, I ſay, beſides the Fortifications augmented, changed, and altered now and then, did not coſt leſs than a Million of Livers yearly; and ſo many other great Garriſons, and Fortifications made in the Netherlands and elſewhere, did exhauſt the Money of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="40">40. How many thouſands of the <hi>French</hi> People did leave their Native Country to retire themſelves into the new Conqueſts, as I inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60783:72"/> elſewhere and where they were leſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with Taxes; and it was ſuppoſed 15 years ago, that above 200 thouſand Souls had left <hi>France</hi> to tranſplant themſelves into the ſaid Conqueſts. I could proffer ſeveral other reaſons, but theſe are enough. I deſire it may be obſerved, that in all this, I do not mention any thing that hath happened ſince this War, nor even the laſt horrid Perſecution of the Proteſtants, the loſs of ſo many People, of the Manufactures of Trade, and of ſo much Money they carried along with them; nor do I ſay any thing of the laſt Mortality, nor of the <hi>French</hi> King's keeping 4 or 500 thouſand Men in Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that 'tis eaſie to perceive from all thoſe reaſons, and others that may be adduced, that <hi>England</hi> ought not only to be more populous, which is the thing I did more particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove, but by neceſſary conſequence, richer alſo and more potent, than <hi>France</hi> ever was, proportionably to the reſpective bigneſſes of both Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Some may perhaps object againſt all my Reaſons, and ſay, if ſo be the Nation is ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, how does it come to paſs that it is not richer and more potent? for an Iſland, ſuch as <hi>England</hi> is, of that extent, and ſo well ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with all the other advantages above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if populous, muſt needs be alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly rich and powerful; and if it be rich and powerful, whence does it come that the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60783:72"/> King's Revenues in time of Peace are ſo ſmall, and nothing near ſo conſiderable as thoſe of the French King, and his Court ſo much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to that of <hi>France,</hi> in ſplendor, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and number of Courtiers, and that his Palace in the Head-City, <hi>viz. Whitehall,</hi> is ſo little comparable in ſumptuouſneſs to the <hi>Louvre?</hi> I anſwer, firſt, That <hi>England</hi> had neither ſo much People, nor ſo much Revenue, as it might and ought to have had, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the advantages it poſſeſſes either from the bounty of Nature, or the form of its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, compared to that of <hi>France.</hi> I know very well the reaſons of it, which 'tis not ſit to mention here. I ſay ſecondly, That tho' <hi>England</hi> is more populous and rich than <hi>France</hi> ever was proportionably to its Extent, that yet the number of all the People of <hi>France,</hi> and the Revenues of that Kingdom, (I do not ſay only of the King's, but the whole Kingdoms) taken in general, did always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the greater extent of the Territory, as I have often ſaid, tho' I believe <hi>England</hi> at preſent out-does <hi>France</hi> very much, as well in the Revenue of Real, and Perſonal Eſtates, and in the Profits of the Induſtry of the People, as alſo in Number of Men fit for Work, Manufactures, Arts, and Trade; <hi>England</hi> I ſay, out does <hi>France</hi> now in all thoſe things, I do not mean comparatively with reference to their reſpective Bigneſs or Extent, but abſolutely, yet there may be more
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60783:73"/> People in <hi>France,</hi> reckoning the Women and Children; and ſo by this reaſon, though the French King ſhould not have over charged his Subjects ſo horribly as he hath done, he ought always to have had formerly more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue than the King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other Points, it was never a ſign or an effect of Poverty in the Nation, that the Revenues of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> their Court, and their Palace were comparatively ſo ſmall; for if the Kings and Parliaments had judged it fit, they might eaſily have altered things, and put them upon another foot, the Nation being Wealthy, and abounding much more in rich Nobility and Gentry than <hi>France,</hi> who can plentifully ſubſiſt of themſelves, without the Places and Benefits of the Court, whereas the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> is generally ſo poor that it cannot ſubſiſt otherwiſe, and it is this, that makes the French Court ſo much frequented by the Nobility, as well as by great numbers of the general Officers of the Forces which that King maintains even in time of Peace, which exceed always two hundred thouſand Men, and mightily vex and cruſh the People; if things ſtand otherwiſe diſpoſed in <hi>England,</hi> 'tis an effect of the Genius and Form of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which has produced that admirable effect which we ſee; that whereas <hi>France</hi> is utterly and irrecoverably deſtroyed by the Abſolute Power of her Monarch, the King of <hi>England</hi> on the contrary finds in the heart and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60783:73"/> good affection of his Subjects, who live plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, all Subſidies neceſſary to ſupply the Wants of the Government, and ſupport the War, as long as will be found convenient.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps who cannot contradict the Reaſons which I have offered to prove that <hi>England</hi> ought to be more populous even at preſent than <hi>France</hi> ever was, will perhaps diſpute the matter of Fact, and ſay, that it has been depopulated by the Colonies in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Plantations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> by the Civil Wars both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the great Maſſacre in the latter, and by the Plague which did carry off ſo much People. To which I anſwer, That there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between the Loſs of Men in <hi>England</hi> by the Civil War, and the Loſs of Men in <hi>France</hi> upon the ſame account; for I dare ſay <hi>France</hi> has loſt ten to one.</p>
               <p>But I anſwer further, That it does not in the leaſt invalidate the Proofs from matter of Fact which I have produced, and need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat here, which prove demonſtratively, that <hi>England</hi> is really more populous than <hi>France</hi> ever was. I grant however, that if it were not for the things objected, <hi>England</hi> ſhould be more populous than it is. And I am of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in particular, that the Plantations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> have done a great prejudice to <hi>England</hi> in that reſpect. But I affirm alſo, that the Civil Wars in <hi>France,</hi> which laſted much longer than they did in <hi>England,</hi> the violent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60783:74"/> and frequent Perſecutions for Religion, not without general and particular Maſſacres, the Plague and Mortality, of which it has not been free neither; its Plantations in <hi>America</hi> alſo, and ſo many great and long Wars abroad without neceſſity, have depopulated <hi>France</hi> much more. But eſpecially the enormous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>France,</hi> the Methods of raiſing them, the ſtupendious multitude of Soldiers that have been kept of long time, the great multitude of Lawyers, and other innumerable Civil Officers, that of the <hi>Maltotiers,</hi> that is to ſay, a great Army of Raſcals and Thieves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Farmers of the Impoſitions, and ſo many other things, ſome of which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before. All thoſe things, I ſay, are enough to convince any rational and unbiaſſed perſon, that <hi>France</hi> could not be ſo populous thirty years ago, as <hi>England</hi> is even now. But above all, I deſire that what I propoſed above concerning the fatal effects of Popery in that Kingdom, might be well weighed. Let us conclude then, that <hi>England</hi> is, and ought to be more populous than <hi>France</hi> ever was, in the time of its greateſt ſplendor.</p>
               <p>So that there is a great Paradox well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The World is full of ſuch groſs miſtakes, but I hope I ſhall prove ſeveral other ſuch Paradoxes, before I die.</p>
               <p>But ſome will object and ſay, Are not we alſo reduced to great Extremities in <hi>England?</hi> Are not the Affairs of our Coin, Exchequer
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60783:74"/> and Banks, in an ill condition? And is not our Army likewiſe unpaid? I confeſs indeed that a great many people ſuffer in <hi>England</hi> by the ill State of the Coin; but 'tis neither an effect of the War, nor yet of any decay of the Riches of the Kingdom; for if it had, all this miſ-fortune would have happened a year ago, for 'tis known, that a twelve-month ago the Affairs of the Kingdom were in ſuch a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, that it was thought fit to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Coin in the heat of the War, and to Eſtabliſh ſeveral great Banks in the Nation, ſo that we may juſtly ſay, that this Accident is a bad effect of the good condition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to which the ſame thing hath happened that uſually befals thoſe, who finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a better ſtate of health than ordinary, attempt to make ſome great Effort by which they find themſelves injured, either becauſe the thing is too great for them, or becauſe they do not make uſe of the beſt Methods to perform it, or that they are croſſed in it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, all the Riches that were in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, are in it ſtill. This was alſo an effect of the too great Indulgence uſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly towards a great number of wicked people in this Kingdom for want of ſtrict Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and a neceſſary Severity, amongſt which there was an incredible number of Clippers, both Men and Women; 'tis they who have done this miſchief, to which the <hi>Stock-Jobbers</hi> have alſo contribued, and the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60783:75"/> Effects of it would have been very bad, even in a time of Peace. Yet we may venture to ſay, that all this would not have done much hurt, if there had been a competent number of Coiners in the Tower, to have Recoined the Clipped Money in a Month's time, for that Money, having been a great while uſeleſs in the Tower and Exchequer, hath added to the Miſchievous Conſequences of it. As for the reſt, tho' the People have ſuffered for a year paſt, and do ſuffer ſtill very much by it, that is not to be compared to the Sufferings which the People of <hi>France</hi> have laboured under ever ſince the beginning of this War, and before it.</p>
               <p>I would fain know of the Gentlemen, who make this Objection, how many People there are in <hi>England,</hi> that, becauſe of this, do ſell their Plate to Goldſmiths, or who ſpend leſs at their Tables, or in Recreations and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, than they did before. Are the Lands and Houſes either ſold, or Farmed at eaſier rates, or are Proviſions which are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, much fallen in their price? for all the Money is ſo ſcarce amongſt the People. Tho' they grumble ſufficiently at the ſcarcity of the Coin, yet they are ſenſible that the diſeaſe is not very great, And indeed, in all the other States of Europe, it would be remedied in two days time, by making uſe of Authority. But in <hi>England</hi> the King and Parliament do in all their conduct, avoid the leaſt appearance of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60783:75"/> conſtraint, even where it would be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe their Affairs are in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as they may eaſily forbear it. But to return to the Clippers, they have diminiſhed the Silver-Coin, it may be, by about 3 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Sterling; but this is not an Abſolute Loſs to the Kingdom, if it be a loſs at all, ſeeing 'tis probable, that all, or the greateſt part of that Metal remains ſtill in the Nation; And it is very likely, nay, certain, that they had Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied the Species of Silver, becauſe ſeveral of them were alſo Coiners, who did make of an Unclip'd Half Crown or Shilling, two of the ſame Species, and 'tis probable, that had it not been for 'em, the Silver-Species would have been leſs copious than it was, However, 'tis an eaſie matter to make up that want, by melting part of the Plate of the Nation, which is exceſſive in quantity; and ſuppoſe 3 Millions Sterling loſt by the Clippers, it would be but inconſiderable to a Kingdom, which may be worth 800 Millions Sterling; I mean all the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, with the People and Their Induſtry. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon then is there to be made between this Kingdom and that of <hi>France,</hi> whereof the Eſtates Real and Perſonal are generally ſunk above the two-thirds in Revenue, and much more in the Capital Stock, as I have already demonſtrated, and where above two-third parts of all the Working-men are deſtroyed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>England</hi> the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60783:76"/> are increaſed in value, as every body knows, without any ſcarcity of Proviſions, and even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſcarcity of Money ſo much complained of.</p>
               <p>This is the true Touch-ſtone of the Good or Bad Condition of a Kingdom, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Real and Perſonal-Eſtates Decreaſe or Increaſe in Value. So that there can be no more compariſon between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> as to that, than between a very health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and luſty Man, and one who is in a deep Conſumption. 'Tis known alſo, that all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade is totally loſt in <hi>France,</hi> except a little in the Streights, whereas in <hi>England</hi> it is otherwiſe. 'Tis true the <hi>French</hi> Privateers are troubleſom, but I ſhall ſhew in its proper place, that they bring no benefit to <hi>France.</hi> 'Tis alſo true, that the Publick Taxes in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did not bring in any thing near of what was expected from them, but this muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the caſual Interruption of the courſe of the Money, and partly to the negligence and indulgence of Aſſeſſors and Collectors, which is ſo very great, that there is nothing like it in the Univerſal World, nor would it be thought credible any where elſe. For they favour whom they pleaſe, and diſpoſe more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Publick Revenues, than they do of their own, which denotes not only the Extream Indulgence of the Government, but alſo that the People are very far from ſuffering, as they do in all Countries, eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> ſince
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60783:76"/> there's not the leaſt ſhaddow of ſeverity or hardſhip, uſed towards them; and beſides, the People themſelves are in a manner the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Arbitrators, who, and what every one muſt pay; and the truth is, they diſpenſe with many thouſands of People from paying any thing, who live better than a great many in <hi>France,</hi> who are obliged to pay every year 50 and 100 Pounds to the <hi>French</hi> King. How ſhould this Nation be fallen into Poverty, ſince 'tis the Nation it ſelf, repreſented by thoſe who are ſuppoſed to be the Wiſeſt Men in the Kingdom, <hi>viz</hi> the Great Council of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Aſſembled in Parliament, which chuſes the Impoſts that are moſt proper, and which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>xes and regulates the Sums, and who themſelves pay cherfully their <hi>quota</hi> of the ſaid Sums, proportionably to every One's Eſtate, and not as in <hi>France,</hi> where they, who order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Taxes, enrich themſelves thereby, and pay nothing; they make part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves, and ſhould put an end to the War, by adviſing the King to make Peace, and denying Subſidies, if they found them ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or unneceſſary to the Nation.</p>
               <p>Some ſimple People, eſpecially Foreigners, are apt to think ſometimes, when they ſee the Parliament ſpend time in deliberating upon Ways and Means to raiſe Money to carry on the War with vigour, that 'tis a ſign that the Nation is exhauſted, and that they do not know what to do, but it is a groſs miſtake.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60783:77"/>
'Tis ſo in <hi>France</hi> indeed, when they are long in their Deliberations about the Impoſitions, 'tis a ſign of great Miſery in that Kingdom, for they have no regard to, nor commiſeration of any body, nor of any condition of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Deſpotical Authority cuts in pieces, tears and devours all without diſtinction. It is a military Government without Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But here in <hi>England</hi> they do not do all that they could do, for if they had, <hi>France</hi> would have been very low long before this, but they do what is moſt proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and moſt agreeable to the humours, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions or intereſts of the People in general, and of every Province and Town; nay, we may almoſt ſay of every individual Perſon, like an impartial Father in his Family.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Impoſitions practiſed in all other Nations with great Succeſs, which the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> has always forborn, through a tender indulgence to the People; as for example, the general Exciſe, which would bring in many Millions, as well as many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Exciſes upon ſeveral things, which are eſtabliſhed in all other Nations, even in time of Peace, to a high degree, but eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> where they amount ſometimes to above twice the value of the Exciſed Commodity. And the truth is, that there are a hundred Ways and Means which might be practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> as they are in all other Nations, if it were not for the great Lenity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60783:77"/> towards the People. But for all this, it is true, that the Shop-keepers, Handicrafts and other Work-men have ſuffered, eſpecially in <hi>London;</hi> as has alſo the Army for want of Payment, and thoſe who lent Money to the King or the Banks, becauſe of the ſcarcity of the Species, which made every one to keep up what Money they had, and to look upon it as much more precious than before; inſomuch that they would not part with it. But all thoſe Tradeſmen, Shop-keepers, and others who had put their Money in the Exchequer or Banks, had either Credit, or ſome Real or Perſonal-Eſtates, and pay either but ſmall Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or none at all, or had ſome Money left them, whereas in <hi>France</hi> that ſort of Men, eſpecially Handicrafts and Labourers, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, not ſo much as a Bed to lye upon, and are beſides over-laden with Taxes, and have been forced for the moſt part to ſerve in the Armies and periſh there; as for thoſe who lent Money to the <hi>French</hi> King, there is no hopes of their recovering their Due, neither Principal nor Intereſt, for all the Stocks of the Kingdom are conſumed, whereas in <hi>England</hi> thoſe who lent their Money to the King, have all the Nation for their ſecurity, ſo that they will not loſe a Farthing. There are but few Tradeſmen and Handicrafts in <hi>England,</hi> but have ſome pieces of Plate or other, which they could ſell if they had been truely in want, and I dare ſay, there is ſcarce one in two hundred
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60783:78"/> who has ſold it, tho' they did not fail of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt the Taxes, the ſcarcity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and want of Trade, becauſe they are not uſed to ſuffer in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> thoſe ſort of Men are not only without Plate, but the moſt part of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of the Kingdom, who had abundance on't formerly, have none at all now, and thoſe who have any yet left, have but very little, for a great many of them had ſold it, even before this War, to ſupply their wants, becauſe of the decay of all their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>As to the ſcarcity of the Coin in <hi>England,</hi> I believe, if a narrow enquiry were made into that Affair, which would be quickly done in another Nation, it would be found that there is perhaps as much Money in <hi>England</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, reckoning Gold-Coin and Plate, as ever there was of all thoſe Species before the War. For though it cannot be denied, but that great Sums of Money, either in Species or in Bills, which is all one, is conveyed out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well for maintaining our Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as for ſome of our Allies; 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable alſo, that as much at leaſt is returned from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and other Countries, for the Commodities which they take from us in greater quantity, than they did before the War, which cauſes all the Products of <hi>England</hi> to ſell well; Without mentioning what we ſpare from <hi>France</hi> in time of War; for it is known, we were over-ballanced by them in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60783:78"/> Trade by ſeveral Millions Sterling, which, with the Travels of our People into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, did Decreaſe us of vaſt Sums Yearly, and we have now all their Manufactures ſettled here by the <hi>Refugies,</hi> by the occaſion of this War, and a better Trade with <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all the reſt of the World.</p>
               <p>It's plain, that our Trade to the <hi>Spaniſh-Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> is greater than ever, for a great part of that Country being Untilled, by reaſon of the War, the Inhabitants, who formerly lived upon their own product, are now for the moſt part ſupplied from <hi>England,</hi> as are alſo the 150000 Men extraordinary, which are every Year in thoſe Countries, belonging to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Armies, beſides what we furniſh them in Horſes, Cloathing and Fewel; And if there is leſs Silver-Coin in <hi>England,</hi> 'tis likely there is more Gold, and Plate than before the War.</p>
               <p>What I ſay as to the Plate, muſt not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a Paradox, for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that moſt of the Clippings were converted into Plate; for the number of Clippers both Men and Women, was ſo great in the Kingdom, that it cannot be doubted but that the moſt part of them ſold their Clippings to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, who were privy to their Crime, at any eaſie rate, and that they got Plate from them for part of the payment, and Unclip'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the other part, and the Goldſmiths did turn the Clippings over again into other Plate. It cannot be otherwiſe, unleſs we will ſuppoſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60783:79"/> that all thoſe Clippers were eminent Trading-men, who did convey the Silver-Ingots to Foreign Countries, which is againſt Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for the moſt part of thoſe Clippers were of the vulgar ſort, and this cannot be practiſed by ſuch kind of People, and eſpecially by thoſe who do not live in <hi>London.</hi> I remember that upon this Subject, I have heard ſome honeſt Gold-Smiths complain, that they were every day obliged againſt their will to ſell their Plate to ſeveral People, who paid them in Money horribly Clipped, which they could not refuſe becauſe it was currant, and that oftentimes the Money that they received did not weigh above the half of the Plate which they ſold for it.</p>
               <p>But altho' the melting of that Clipped, has diminiſhed the quantity, not of the Metal, but of the Species, yet many do fancy that there is leſs of them remaining than really there is, and there are ſeveral reaſons which make people fancy ſo. Firſt, Becauſe there is ſtill a conſiderable quantity which is to be Melted, and lies unprofitable to Trade as long as it does not come out. Secondly, People obſerving that they are ſuddenly reduced from a plenty of Species, to a ſcarcity of the ſame, are apt to judge, that the Kingdom is altogether ruined, which cauſes all thoſe who have unclipped Money or Gold by them, to put a greater eſtimate upon it, as I inſinuated before, than they did formerly, and to keep it more cloſe; ſo that neither that which is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60783:79"/> in the Exchequer or the Mint does appear, nor yet that which is in the hand of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And they are confirmed in their opinion by the <hi>Stock-Jobbers,</hi> who very much raiſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ready Money, and do for their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt bring a diſrepute upon the Affairs of the Kingdom, making people believe, that the Miſchief is much greater than really it is. So that every one keeps his Money more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gathers up all that which falls into his hands, and takes occaſion upon pretence of the publick ſcarcity of Money, and upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral complainr that no body now pays Debts, to buy all upon Truſt, and ſo neither pay their own Debts, nor Taxes, tho' they be very well provided with Money. Several people have experienced, that the general noiſe of the ſcarcity of Money, cauſed ſome of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers and Debtors, tho' well ſtored with it, to put off their Payment from week to week, and month to month, under pretence that they had none, and yet they paid them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as ſoon as the Guineas were at thirty ſhillings, and that they heard they would fall; and the ſame was alſo found when the broad old Money was ready to be cryed down, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when the hammered Money did follow the ſame fate. For then a great many people who kept abundance of it hoarded up, began to buy what they wanted, and to pay their Debts. And to that purpoſe, I dare ſay, that two Millions of Pounds Coined out of all the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60783:80"/> Plate of the Nation (which amounts perhaps to five or ſix Millions Sterling) would, with what is already Coined, make three or four Millions of inviſible Coin in the Nation to come out, like a little Water powr'd into the Pump, helps to draw a great deal more of it out of a Ship. That Opinion of the Poverty of the Kingdom is alſo abetted and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the ill-affected Party, and the ſaid <hi>Stock-Jobbers</hi> to the utmoſt degree, ſo that many even of the well-affected are inclined to fancy ſo too, for want of a due examination of the matter.</p>
               <p>Further, ſeveral of the Malcontents do hoard up Money for ſeveral bad purpoſes. Beſides, it muſt be acknowledged, that many honeſt people, ſeeing the eagerneſs of our Enemies againſt the King's Life, are afraid that he may be Aſſaſſinated, and that then a fatal Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may inſue from it, which makes them keep up their Money that they may help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it in ſuch an Extremity. 'Tis ſaid alſo, that the Country-Farmers, who never did thrive better than ſince this War, have hoarded up much of it Some ſay alſo, that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Bankrupts carry it away more than ever, to Priviledg'd Places. Theſe, with ſome others of the ſame kind, are the Reaſons which occaſions the ſcarcity of Money amongſt the People, and that the Army, and thoſe who have Lent Money to the King are not paid, and not the War, nor the Taxes, which have
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60783:80"/> been very ill paid this year, tho' very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to what they are in other States and Countries now in War, for their Subjects pay much more in time of Peace than the Engliſh Nation does in this time of War. I do not mean the French, who are perfect Slaves, but even the Dutch, whoſe Lands and Houſes pay generally and conſtantly, ſince the War, about three quarters of their Revenue, beſides the hundredth Penny of the Stock which they pay twice ſometimes in the year, beſides the general Exciſe upon all things whatſoever, and many other Impoſitions. So that 'tis viſible that the ſaid Scarcity of the Currant Coin, and the above-mentioned ill Effects of it, has not proceeded from any real decay in the Stock of <hi>England,</hi> but from the Lenity of the Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>If the Nation had ſuffered for want of Coin before the Clipped Money was cryed down, the Great Council of the Nation would not have cryed it down, or they might have cauſed the Plate to be melted; ſuch a thing was done in <hi>France</hi> 5 years ago, but upon very diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious conditions to the Subjects, for they were forced to carry their Plate to the Mint, as alſo all the old Coin, both Gold and Silver, on pain of a total confiſcation of all they kept by them; For which, inſtead of ready Money they received at the Mint a Paper, mentioning the quantity of the Plate and old Coin brought in by ſuch a one, and ſubſcribed by the Officers
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60783:81"/> of the Mint, with promiſe that their due would be paid in ſome Months time, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. But when the time was elapſed, they came hundreds of times before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Money; and when they received it, they were obliged to loſe the 6th part of their Plate and Money: Others could not get one penny, but when the Sum owing them was conſiderable, they were forced to lend it the King, and they noted as rich Perſons.</p>
               <p>Let Man compare ſuch proceedings with thoſe of the Parliament here, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give five ſhillings and eight pence for the Ounce of Plate, and to pay the Intereſt of it, without conſtraining any Man to bring it in againſt his own will.</p>
               <p>If any Men ſay that <hi>France</hi> did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need; he ſpeaks mighty injuriouſly of that King and his Counſel, for why ſhould he have given ſo much trouble to his People, and made them loſe ſo much, if he did not need Money? for he has done it twice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this five or ſix years; the firſt riſe of the Money was 5 <hi>d per</hi> Crown, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was 7 <hi>d.</hi> more, in all twelve pence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Crown, and the ſame upon all other Species, both of Gold and Silver in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; why ſhould he have ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited his own Affairs without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? for there is nothing that does more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to a Nation's Credit, than ſuch a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. And never any wiſe Prince or Nation
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60783:81"/> did uſe ſuch Methods, without great neceſſity, I mean to raiſe the value of the Coin, with ſuch a great loſs to the People. This method is looked on by Politicians, as the Emetik-Wine is by Phyſicians, who do not uſe to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it but in violent Diſeaſes, or as the <hi>Anchora ſacra</hi> of the Heathens, which was caſt only when they thought the Ship was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be Shipwrack'd without it. And this would be ſo much the more injurious to the <hi>French</hi> King, that he has engaged in this War without neceſſity, and that when he is pleaſed to give ſatisfaction to King <hi>William,</hi> and to his Allies, as to what he hath taken from them, the Peace may be concluded eaſily. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> indeed ought to ſpend their Eſtates and Lives to the laſt Man, in ſuch a War as this, becauſe their Religion, Liberties, Eſtates and Lives lye at a ſtake, but the <hi>French</hi> K. has no ſuch thing to fear from the Allies; they deſire nothing from him but what belongs <hi>de jure</hi> to 'em. We muſt acknowledge that Abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is a dangerous Weapon, even to thoſe who make uſe of it, for you may ſee to what extremities and ſhifts it has brought not only the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> but alſo the King himſelf. We muſt grant alſo, that 'tis an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>Reſſource,</hi> if ſo be it could laſt long, but 'tis like a vehement Feaver and Burning, which gives ſtrength for a little while to the Body which is agitated by it, and cauſes the perſon to make aſtonſhing Efforts, but waſts
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60783:82"/> him away in a little time. Or like the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſome Perſons, poſſeſſed by Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who will go an hundred Leagues in leſs time than others can go ten, but at the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's end find themſelves ſo bruiſed, that they can never recover again.</p>
               <p>This Arbitrary Power, as 'tis exerciſed at this day in <hi>France,</hi> has the ſame apparent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for a little time, over a wiſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Government, as to Pride and Oſtentation, as a Spendthrift who devours all his Stock, has over another, who may be as rich or richer than he, but is contented to ſpend leſs than his ordinary Revenue, and lays part of it by for future emergencies, and making good the loſſes that may befal him: It is ordinary for the Vulgar to ſpeak of, and admire the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer much more than the latter, and that the former may do, and many times really does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things in compariſon of the other, ho' very often below the vaſt Expences and the great Efforts that he makes. But all this glory which he purchaſes by it, is but of a ſhort duration, and the applauſe he gets too is only from Fools; whereas the praiſe of a good Husband endures for ever; The firſt ruines his Family, and will be infallibly hated and deteſted by all wiſe Men, even when he makes the greateſt noiſe in the World and thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the moſt admired, and at laſt alſo by the vulgar People who admired him at firſt, when they ſee Himſelf and his Family ruined
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60783:82"/> by his Vanity and Folly. And all Poſterity will make the ſame Judgment of him.</p>
               <p>If a Soveraign employs his Deſpotical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to deſtroy and lay waſte his People by Tyranny, and his Neighbours by War; he is like to incurr the ſame fate, which we have obſerved in ſeveral great Wranglers at Law in <hi>France,</hi> who being born with a conſiderable Eſtate, and ſome Vigour of Mind, did raiſe unjuſt Suits againſt all their Neighbours, becauſe they were well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Knaviſh and Skilful Atturneys and underſtood the wranglings and formalities of Juſtice themſelves. They had an incomparable Talent to proſecute and make all other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple mad, and to attain their own ends. Every body was ſurprized to ſee them charged with ſo many Suits at once, and that they got the beſt in almoſt all of them, tho' their Cauſes were unjuſt, and that ſome of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries had as much skill and wit as they had themſelves; So that they carried now a Farm, and then a Houſe or a Field from their Neighbours, and were loaden with all their Spoil.</p>
               <p>But it came to paſs at laſt, that after ſome years, the ſaid Wranglers were utterly ruined, and reduced to beggary; tho' they did as yet appear to be in poſſeſſion of ſome Lands and Houſes, but they were over-whelmed with debts; then thoſe who had loſt their Eſtates with them at Law, did find ways to recover them,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60783:83"/> becauſe the Wranglers had not wherewithal to ſupport their Unjuſtice any further. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they gained all their Cauſes, was not only that they had very skillful Atturneys, and at the ſame time great Knaves, who could forge falſe Titles, but that they ſpared no coſt to bribe and corrupt thoſe of the other ſide, and placed their glory in conquering ſo by any means whatſoever, tho' the Expences did very much exceed the value of the thing in queſtion. Whereas their Neighbours, tho' as wealthy, and more prudent than they, truſting to the Juſtice of their Cauſes, contented themſelves to defray the ordinary Charges of Law-Suits, and made uſe of no means but what were honeſt and lawful, being unwilling to incommode their Affairs, and ruine their Families, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they could not believe that their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries would make uſe of ſuch tricks, which would coſt them very dear, and were able to ruine them, and that for a trifle ſometimes, which was the ground of their Debates. Every body did commend the honeſty of the latter, tho' they loſt their Cauſe, and did curſe the conduct of the unjuſt Wrangler, except ſome ill Men, as unjuſt as himſelf, or ſome who got advantage and profit by his Unjuſtice, and the Monks and Prieſts to whom he made Preſents, and did enter himſelf into their Fraternities, to the end they ſhould ſpeak well of him, and made them believe, that when he brought an Action againſt ſuch a one, and ſuch a one,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60783:83"/> to get their Lands from them, he did it with intent to beſtow the ſame upon the Church. Such Wranglers have often been ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> who ruined themſelves in that manner, amongſt whom there was one that did all thoſe things that I have mentioned, and to repair in ſome manner his Reputation, did think fit to make himſelf a Prieſt at laſt. Another gave the little remnant he had kept of his Eſtate to the Monks, depriving his Family of it, that he might at leaſt be commended by them, and did apply himſelf to the perſecuting of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> which gain'd him the hearts of the Clergy, while all the honeſt among the Papiſts themſelves deteſted him more and more.</p>
               <p>I am aſſured, whatever the Friends of <hi>France</hi> and the Foes of <hi>England,</hi> may think on't, that if ſo be the <hi>French</hi> King did govern in <hi>England,</hi> with the ſame Authority he does in <hi>France,</hi> which God forbid, he could raiſe more eaſily 25 Millions Sterling in it Yearly during ſome years, than he can 16 at preſent in <hi>France.</hi> My reaſon is, that <hi>England</hi> is worth much more now than <hi>France,</hi> as I have already ſaid.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ask, how the <hi>French</hi> King with all his Authority, could find ſuch Sums Yearly in <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing there is not ſo much Money in the Nation, and that 'tis impoſſible to find Money where there is none.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, he would find out ways enough to make People to get it, tho' there was none. I have ſaid already, that Money was wanting in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60783:84"/> 
                  <hi>France</hi> 5 years ago, ſeeing he commanded the Plate to be carried to the Mint, and forced e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to carry their old Coin to be Stamped a-new, and then raiſed the value of it. This has been done twice in 6 years time, as was ſaid before, and yet he finds Money ſtill, tho' there has been abundance conveyed out of the Kingdom every year, as 'tis eaſie to conceive, for Horſes from <hi>Germany</hi> and other Countries, for Naval-Stores, for Corn in the year of the great Famine, for the <hi>Turks,</hi> for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and all the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and for the <hi>French</hi> Army in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which has carried out of <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Money that will never return, beſides what has been carried out for Foreign Fiſh, and other neceſſaries, and for all their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies abroad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis one of thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Abſolute Power, of which I ſpoke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that they have found out in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the way to multiply the Money without increaſing the quantity of it, by cauſing it to paſs by a quick and violent circulation twenty times a year, thro' the King's hands. Which is thus, There are, as is well known, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſorts of Impoſitions and Taxes, both Publick and Private in <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as one, or a quarter of one is paid by the People, 'tis preſently diſtributed for the uſe of the War, or to pay ſome Penſions or Rents, one way or other, and as ſoon as 'tis in the People's hands, 'tis got out of them again in ſome Weeks,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60783:84"/> Days or Hours by another Impoſition, and ſo continually from one end of the Year to the other.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any other Circulation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Kingdom. In this conſiſtsalmoſt all its Trade: People fancy when they hear of ſo many great Squadrons of Men of War, as the News tell us, are equipped in <hi>France,</hi> that the King muſt have vaſt Sums of Money in his hands, and that Money muſt be plentiful in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becauſe they think that things are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned there as they are here; where we have but a ſmall number of general Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons regulated all at once by the Parliament, and very moderate in reſpect of what they are in other Nations, as alſo in reſpect of the Wealth of the Kingdom, and which are raiſed in a gentle way, without great charge to the Subject. But in <hi>France</hi> the Taxes are without number, they are not only General and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but Particular and Private upon Private Corporations, Orders and Ranks of Men, and private Perſons, and upon all thoſe in general, who are preſumed to have Money or ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Eſtate, who, many times are forced to pay to the King, not the 100th or 200th penny, but the third part, or the half of all their Stock, and ſometimes all that they have. Formerly they were all regulated at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year, but at preſent they are ſet up every Month, Week, Day, and Hour of the Year, according to the wants of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60783:85"/> Court, and when one falls ſhort of what they expected, then preſently comes out anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or ſome new Offices are created, and ſome hundreds or thouſands of Men forced to buy them, whether they have Money or no, or many thouſands of other private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are forced to pay the Taxes of eaſie, <hi>i. e.</hi> wealthy Men, <hi>gens aiſes,</hi> as they call them, tho' they be already ruined.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs, I muſt confeſs, that I think there was more Money in <hi>France</hi> 30 years ago, than there was in <hi>England,</hi> and this for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſons.</p>
               <p>The great Impoſitions upon the People in <hi>France,</hi> and the great ſeverities practiſed againſt the inſolvent, obliged the People to live fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, and to work hard, and to gather up Money for the ſaid Taxes as faſt as they could by all means, which cauſed the Money to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Kingdom, and made the People very induſtrious for ſome forty or fifty years, having a great Trade with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and did draw in Money from Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Beſides, there were many more Men that hoarded up Money in <hi>France</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> where, becauſe of the great Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is moſt in the hands of Merchants, Goldſmiths, and Trading-people, and goes from hand to hand very quick; for Money did always circulate much more in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe of the great Trade, and that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commonly lays out prodigious Sums of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60783:85"/> Money in Foreign Commodities. So that there is at all times an incredible quantity of imported Goods in Store-houſes that drains the Money from <hi>England,</hi> and eſpecially for <hi>French</hi> Commodities in time of Peace; for 'tis eaſie to conceive, that ſuch a Nation as this, in ſuch a rich and plentiful Country, and under ſuch an indulgent Government, and paying almoſt nothing for the maintaining of it, is apt to ſpend in Foreign extravagant Dreſſes, Delicacies, Baubles and Trinkets, and in all their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into <hi>France,</hi> and any where elſe, what Money other Nations are uſed to pay to their Government, and eſpecially the <hi>French</hi> Nation, oppreſſed continualy with Taxes for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their K's ſplendid Court, and of his numerous Armies. For altho' the King of <hi>France</hi> did convey yearly abundance of Money out of his Kingdom upon his Intrigues, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and Correſpondencies abroad, yet his People drew in a great deal more Money from <hi>England</hi> and other Nations, than they ſpent a long time. For they ſuffered very few Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be imported into their Kingdom, eſpecially from <hi>England,</hi> charging their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities with horrid Impoſitions; So that they did pay to their Cuſtoms very near half the value of the Commodity, as I could juſtifie; when at the ſame time <hi>England</hi> was glutted with an infinite quantity of dear, ſuperfluous, vain and noxious things from <hi>France.</hi> So that by thoſe ways <hi>England</hi> was over-ballanced by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60783:86"/> ſeveral Millions Sterling Yearly, in their Trade by the <hi>French,</hi> who did plunder us and other Neighbouring Nations, who were not wiſe enough in that reſpect. And then that Money by the circulation did paſs thro' the hands of an infinite number of thrifty and frugal People in <hi>France</hi> who did hoard it up.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation had forborn all thoſe exceſſes in Importations, eſpecially from <hi>France,</hi> and kept good Order and Diſcipline in that and other things, Money would have been much more plentiful in <hi>England,</hi> and much leſs in <hi>France,</hi> for this, and the continual Travels of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry into that Country, did very much contribute to raiſe <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another cauſe of their riſe and firſt-growth, was the Eſtabliſhment of the Republick of <hi>Holland;</hi> for after it was ſettled, and the Peace made with the Spaniards, the States finding themſelves very rich in People and Money, by the great multitudes that had retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Spaniſh Netherlands for ſhelter againſt the D. of <hi>Alba's</hi> Tyranny, and ſeeing the Land was not able to furniſh them with Victuals, nor to improve their Money, they betook themſelves to the French Trade, and by degrees became the general Carriers of <hi>France,</hi> which obliged the French to Till their Ground better than they had done before; and finding the ſweetneſs of Foreign Money, they were by degrees brought alſo to Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60783:86"/> all ſorts of Manufactures, which the Dutch did carry likewiſe over all the World, till at laſt the French taking advantage of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Neighbouring Princes, they impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Laws upon their Subjects. Before that great Revolution <hi>France</hi> and her Kings were very poor, and the Engliſh much too ſtrong for them, and had, for the moſt part, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them in all the Wars; ſo that it has been a great miſtake in the Politicks of <hi>France,</hi> to declare War againſt theſe two Nations, who did enrich her ſo prodigiouſly, and could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruine her being United together. But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> became in theſe laſt Times mightily afraid of the French King's Power, therefore ſhe thought neceſſary to give it a Diverſion; and as that Court does watch for opportunities to make advantage of all things, and to bring down even the Popiſh Princes, when they begin to be afraid of them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing them all by ſecret Ways, Springs, and Wheels, eſpecially by their Confeſſors, they have made uſe of the Jeſuits, who pay a blindfold Obedience to their General, as he does to the Pope, to put the French King, whom they knew ambitious, upon the deſign of ſubverting the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland, France,</hi> &amp;c. as the moſt glorious thing he could ever undertake, thinking that either he ſhould ſucceed in it, and bring all thoſe People under the Pope's Yoke, or elſe that he ſhould break his Neck in that deſign,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60783:87"/> and ruine his Kingdom, whoſe Power was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe of the King's prodigious Authority, as alſo becauſe he had threatned the Popes ſeveral times. And the truth is, that all the honeſt Men of the Roman Religion in <hi>France,</hi> had for a long time great hopes that he ſhould have ſhaken off that Yoke.</p>
               <p>The Power and Riches of <hi>England</hi> do not depend upon ſuch Caſualties as thoſe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, I mean ſuch a Revolution as fell out in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Weakneſs of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes, or the like; for the Power of <hi>England</hi> is ſettled on a ſolid and conſtant Baſis, that is, the advantages of her Soil, Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Religion and Government, far above all the advantages of <hi>France:</hi> Inſomuch that as often as <hi>England</hi> had any good King or Queen, it did always make <hi>France</hi> to tremble; and <hi>England</hi> might be a great deal more powerful and rich if ſome impediments and clogs to its Power and Strength, which are meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, and eaſie to take away, were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but I dare not mention them as yet.</p>
               <p>Thoſe People whom I ſaid, did Treaſure up Money in <hi>France,</hi> did it for ſeveral reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, To pay the great Publick and Private Taxes that they are liable to now and then, which failing, they are in danger to be ruined, or to loſe all their Credit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To buy ſome Offices if they had none, or more conſiderable ones, if they had any.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:60783:87"/>
               <p>Thirdly, To be admitted Farmers of the Impoſitions, where ready Money was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, and the Profits unſpeakable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To buy the Eſtates of Noblemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at an eaſie rate, for the Nobility have ever been at a low Ebb, under this Reign, liable to a thouſand Vexations, and forced to ſell their Eſtates cheap to pay their Debts and get Money to live.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Becauſe of the Ruine of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry, ſaving Men did keep their Money up in their Coffers, becauſe they could find no good ſecurity to lend it upon, for thoſe reaſons, I ſay, there was much Money hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, A great many deſired to purchaſe Nobility for Money; Others to be rehabilitated in their Nobility, which they had forfeited by Merchandizing, or otherwiſe: And others ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Money to buy ſome Governments, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the <hi>Militia,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. has found means to bring out, by his violent and extraordinary Impoſitions and Extortions, ſince the beginning of this laſt War.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould conquer <hi>England,</hi> as I ſaid before, which God forbid, he would work Miracles here, and cauſe Money to be found where there is none, and all the whole form of the Nation would be ſuddenly and abſolutely altered. He would convert the Luxury, Licentiouſneſs, and all the ſeveral ſorts of Debauchery in the Nation, into Money,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60783:88"/> by Taxing the guilty Perſons. He would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer little or no Importation of Goods from any other place but <hi>France.</hi> And by that means the Nation would be able to pay him greater Impoſitions and Taxes. All the fine Cattle with which <hi>England</hi> doth ſo much abound, would be tranſported and ſold for Money; as alſo their Plate, Jewels, Houſhold-goods, Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Nation would not be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpend ſo much in Cloathing, in Silks, fine Linnen, Delicacies and Wines of all ſorts. All their fine Woollen-cloath Stuffs, Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be applied to his own uſe, and converted into Money. And it may be he would appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to himſelf the Mineral Grounds as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Soveraign, as the Gold and Silver Mines are commonly judged to be. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-people ſhould not be ſuffered to feed any more upon good Meat, but upon Roots and Whey, and the Blood and Livers of Oxen, Brown-bread, and Water inſtead of Beer and Ale; Wooden-ſhoes inſtead of Leather; courſe Canvas inſtead of fine Linnen. The Money would be only imployed in maintaining great Armies, and multitudes of Prieſts and Monks. And in a word, he would purſue the ſame methods of Government, that he does in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome may object again, that ſince the beginning of this War, we hear nothing but a parcel of idle Stories about the ill State of Affairs in <hi>France,</hi> and we ſee, notwithſtanding
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60783:88"/> the <hi>French</hi> King holds out ſtill, and is as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as ever.</p>
               <p>This is juſt like the Opinion that People do commonly entertain of a Man that lives high and eats up his Stock. That Man, for example, may have two thouſand Pounds Sterling <hi>per Annum</hi> and ſpends five thouſand every Year. The underſtanding Men who know his Eſtate, ſay, that he ruines himſelf; Other People who hear them ſay ſo, and yet ſee him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to live at the ſame rate for ten or twelve Years together, will ſay, this Man holds out ſtill, and we ſee that he is a Man of good ſenſe, who manages his Expences well, and therefore they conclude he is richer than he is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported. So that they cannot be undeceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the matter, till they ſee him in the Goal.</p>
               <p>The Extravagant Notions which moſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have of the <hi>French</hi> King's Power, are ſuch, that if ſo be things did anſer their fancy, that <hi>Kingdom</hi> ought to be ten or twelve times bigger than <hi>England,</hi> have ten or twelve times as much People, be ten or twelve times more fruitful, better ſituated and fitted for Trade, and richer alſo than <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a hard matter to convince ſuch People of their errour, who have neither any true Idea of <hi>France</hi> nor of <hi>England,</hi> but only ſome prejudicated Opinions, which have no other ground but the good Eſteem they have of their own ſenſe, without any ſolid or diſtinct prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and who do never reflect upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60783:89"/> nor upon what hath happened before their own Eyes. Have we not ſeen that ſince the War, which the French King declared againſt the Dutch in 1672. the Land-Eſtates in <hi>France</hi> have been continually decaying more and more, as I inſinuated already, becauſe of the great Efforts the Kingdom did make at that time, and of the interruption of Trade? But what was that War, compared to this, which had been beſides preceded by a general and cruel Perſecution of the Proteſtants over all the Kingdom, which had diſturbed all the Trade of it?</p>
               <p>Do not they remember what the Spaniards, when alone in War with <hi>France,</hi> did about fifty years ago, when they laid under Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution the very Suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> and did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carry away the Citizens of that Place Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners? Have they forgot that the Germans, about 20 years ago, did take ſeveral Towns from the French in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and that they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated part of the <hi>Arrier-Ban</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Zell</hi> took the Town of <hi>Treves</hi> from the French, after he had Routed the <hi>Mareſchal de Crequy.</hi> 'Tis certain <hi>France</hi> did make very great Efforts then, ſince which ſhe never could recover her ſelf; and that ſhe was much richer, and more populous then than ſhe is now. How came it to paſs that ſhe could not then reſiſt ſuch ſmall Armies? Have they forgotten alſo how that the Dutch alone made ſeveral Provinces of <hi>France</hi> to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60783:89"/> tremble, when they Invaded the Iſſe of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moutier,</hi> whereby all their Coaſts were kept in Alarm, about 20 years ago: Since that time have we not ſeen in this War the Germans to take <hi>Bonne</hi> and <hi>Mentz?</hi> who can believe that that Kingdom is richer now, and more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than it was then?</p>
               <p>And what if they ſhould continue yet two years longer with greater forces than they have done hitherto? muſt we believe therefore that they are in a better condition? Have we not ſeen the French chaſed away from <hi>Ireland</hi> ſome years ago, meerly becauſe of their Weakneſs and want of Power? we cannot ſay that they did not care to maintain themſelves there; how came it to paſs then, if <hi>France</hi> be really ſo powerful, that it did not make greater Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to keep that Kingdom? for it had been a fatal Blow to <hi>England,</hi> and to all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, <hi>un coup de partie,</hi> as the French call it: But, inſtead of ſhewing their great Power there, their Forces were not paid, and they were obliged to Coin Copper-Money inſtead of Silver, and did plunder and ruine the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> their beſt Friends. Any body converſant in Hiſtory, knows that the Spaniſh-Power was for a great time Superior to the <hi>French,</hi> which obliged the Kings of <hi>France</hi> to deſire the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> inſomuch that, in order to endear themſelves to them, they all required to be Knights of the Garter, from <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. to <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. and no
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60783:90"/> body is Ignorant, that for many years they paid a kind of Tribute to the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and had it not been for the Diſſentions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at home, which brought their Forces away from <hi>France,</hi> 'tis probable they ſhould have Lorded over <hi>France</hi> to this very day. 'Tis alſo well known, that even long after the Diſcovery of <hi>America</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the opening of their Gold and Silver Mines, <hi>H.</hi> the IV. did never get from his People above 20 Millions of Livers, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. about 70, tho' the oppreſſion of the People was then very great; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. tho' a great Tyrant, could not get above 4 Millions Yearly from his Subjects. And if we may judge of the Revenues of <hi>France,</hi> by that of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIth's Expences, they were ſmall enough at that time, for there was found a reckoning in the Chamber of Accounts at <hi>Paris,</hi> of 2 <hi>s.</hi> for new Sleeves to his old Doublet, and three half pence for Liquor to greaſe his Boots. Unleſs People will fancy that <hi>France</hi> grows richer, and gets ſtrength by this War.</p>

               <p>But if it be ſo, how comes it to paſs that ſhe ſets all her wits at work to procure a Peace? She who did always boaſt that ſhe gave it to all the World. How is it that ſince ſome years
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60783:90"/> we have ſeen many Conſpiracies againſt <hi>King William</hi>'s Life? How is it that we hear from all parts, that all her People is reduced to the laſt gaſp? Not to repeat what I have ſaid already of their Plate, converted into Coin many years ago by the King's Command, and of the Coin raiſed twice ſince the War. There are many ſevere and violent Impoſitions, and Publick and Private Taxes, which croſs and deſtroy one another. As for example, they have ſold ſome thouſands of Offices to People, who were unwilling to buy them, and when the Court had received their Money, they were abrogated under pretence that they were chargeable to the Kingdom, as indeed they were, and ſome Months after they forced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again to buy them. They have done the ſame by ſeveral thouſands who were forced to buy Letters of the Nobility, and when the Money was delivered, ſome time after there was a Declaration from the King. That all thoſe who had been made Nobles within this laſt hundred years, ſhould pay the ſame Sum for their Confirmation, which they paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They have done many ſuch things theſe five or ſix years laſt, which ſhews that they are put to the laſt ſhifts. Such practices were never heard of in any other Nation under the Sun.</p>
               <p>Here is another remarkable example, There are ſeveral People who died ſince the Capitation was ſet up; now all their Friends are forced to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60783:91"/> pay the ſaid Poll-Tax for the dead, whether they left any Eſtate or no. There are many <hi>French</hi> People here in <hi>England</hi> who confirm this.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I deſire no more from thoſe who will needs entertain ſuch a great Opinion of the Riches and Power of <hi>France,</hi> but that they would anſwer the reaſons, by which I ſhew evidently that <hi>England</hi> is and ought to be more populous and rich proportionably to it's Extent, than <hi>France</hi> ever was, and conſequently much more than it is at preſent, or that they ſhould bring any ſolid reaſon to oblige me to call in queſtion what I advanced upon that Subject.</p>
               <p>They muſt not alledge againſt me, what I acknowledged before, <hi>viz</hi> that I think there was more Money in <hi>France</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> and that for a conſiderable time they had all the advantage of the Trade with us, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Laws upon the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> about Trade, for that was meerly accidental, and for a time only, by reaſon of the weakneſs of thoſe who did then govern the Neighbouring Nations; but ſuppoſe <hi>France</hi> had got 100 Millions of Livers in Coin by it, above what it ſhould have had naturally without it, what ſignifies that to the value of a Kingdom worth perhaps 18 or 20 thouſand Millions of Livers. 'Tis not the plenty of Coin hoarded up, that makes a Kingdom rich; 'tis the great Revenues of Real and Perſonal-Eſtates, and of the Profits of Induſtry and Trade. The Province of <hi>Holland</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:60783:91"/> alone has more Money than all <hi>England</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet the People has not the fifth part of the Revenues in Real and Perſonal-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of what <hi>England</hi> has, the Profits of Trade excluded. A Gentleman who has but a thouſand Pounds of Revenue and one or two thouſand Pounds in ready Money, is not ſo rich as another, who has leſs ready Money, and has three thouſand Pounds Revenue. When a Monied-man, who hath no great Revenue, but ſome accidental Profits now and then, is profuſe in his Expence, the Money is ſoon gone, ſo has it been with <hi>France.</hi> She had plenty of Money by the negligence of her Neighbours, and was uſed to govern the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, and to get advantages over them, it made her proud; She thought it would have laſted thus for ever, and now She is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to ſee, that her Neighbours are come to their wits, and better governed and wiſer than before: She cannot endure it, as thinking She loſes all her former Glory, and will rather periſh than yield, being unwilling, as it were, to ſurvive her ſelf; ſo that, <hi>Flectere ſi nequeat Superes, Acheronta movebit,</hi> being puffed up with the Invaſions and Conqueſts made upon her Neighbours, and with the Reputation She had unjuſtly gotten, of Prudence and Greatneſs, and by the Flatteries of the Clergy, and ſome other mercenary Pens, and the manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Inſcriptions ſet up at all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Paris</hi> and ſome of them very Impious,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60783:92"/> to the Glory of her Monarch; I ſay, <hi>France</hi> being puffed up with ſo much vain Glory, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to think that her Laurels ſhould fade, and her pretended Glory to be obſcured in the leaſt, ſo that She ſtands ſtiffly againſt the Torrent, which is in plain Terms to reſiſt God and his Providence whereby he hath declared againſt her for all the cruelty, violations of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that She is guilty of.</p>
               <p>I know that ſome will be yet apt to ſay, that <hi>France</hi> is of a larger Extent than I allow, and that ſhe contains at leaſt 100, or 120 Millions of Acres. But beſides what I ſaid already, that I would not recede from Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> whom I think to have had good Reaſons for his Computation of the Extent of <hi>France;</hi> I ſay further, that if any body would ſuppoſe that <hi>France</hi> contains 100, or 200 Millions of Acres, it would prejudge their Cauſe inſtead of being ſubſervient to it; for, how much greater the Extent of a Countrey is with a few People, the leſs it is worth; tis the great multitude of People, and not the Extent of a Kingdom, that makes it valuable, as I ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Now I have ſhewn before by a kind of demonſtration, that <hi>England</hi> is much more populous than <hi>France,</hi> which we ſuppoſed to contain 82 Millions of Acres, ever was, by the compariſon I made of <hi>London</hi> and the other Towns in <hi>England,</hi> with <hi>Paris</hi> and all the Towns of the 4 greateſt Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> which take almoſt as much ground as <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:60783:92"/> does. Now it is clear, that how much the more <hi>France</hi> will be enlarged beyond the ſaid 82 Millions of Acres, the more will my Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be confirmed, and <hi>France</hi> appear poorer and leſs populous.</p>
               <p>Some may alſo alledge, That <hi>France</hi> was alſo more populous 30 years ago, than I made it to be, allowing only 500 perſons to every one of her Pariſhes one with another. If I have committed an Errour as to that, it will be much greater in relation to the Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> to which I allowed only 600 perſons one with another; for 'tis eaſie to ſee by all the Reaſons above brought forth, that thoſe of <hi>England</hi> ought to be more populous, at leaſt by the third, than thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> whereas I allow them only a 6th part more People. They muſt know, that I am ſo far from aggravating the Diſadvantages of <hi>France,</hi> which are already great enough, that I do rather extenuate them. As for example, I ſuppoſe yet 9 Millions of People in <hi>France,</hi> tho' I do not believe there are eight, nor that their preſent Revenues are ſo great as I make them. I valued the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of <hi>France</hi> before theſe laſt 30 years at 1000 Millions, taking in the Profits of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, but I do not believe that they did ever exceed 800 Millions, by reaſon of Popery, and its conſequences. And ſo I reckoned the People of <hi>England</hi> to be only ſix Millions now, tho' ſeveral Authors reckon them at ſeven Millions. I valued likewiſe the Revenue of Lands in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60783:93"/> 
                  <hi>England</hi> at 8 Millions Sterling as ſome have done before me, but I believe in truth that it amounts at leaſt to ten Millions, and ſo I did in ſeveral other things indulge <hi>France,</hi> whoſe miſery is inexpreſſible. As for example, about the number of working-men, who are leſs in number than I ſaid. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all what we can ſay, there are ſome, and even honeſt people, who have ſuch a mighty conceit of the Greatneſs and Power of <hi>France,</hi> that they will not admit of any Reaſons againſt their prejudicate Opinion, tho' they bring none to ſupport it, and they are confirmed in it by the Foreign News-mongers that keep Correſpondencies with the Noveliſts of <hi>Paris,</hi> who writ them a thouſand Lies, becauſe they would not be ſuffered, but rather puniſhed ſeverely, and hanged too, if they did write any thing that was not to the advantage of <hi>France;</hi> and 'tis not improbable but that they are even rewarded by the Court for the News they write, for by that means they do the ſame thing among the Allies, which the Spies of <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, when coming from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the Inhabitants were all Gyants, much bigger and ſtronger than they really were, which cauſed the hearts of the Iſraelites to faint; <hi>France</hi> has practiſed ſeveral ſuch cunning Methods for a long time, againſt her Neighbours:</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:60783:93"/>
               <p>As for example, all the Letters of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſts of <hi>Paris</hi> did report lately, that there is more Money in <hi>France</hi> than ever was; ſome others, that they find as many Soldiers as they wiſh. 'Tis viſible, that all theſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Lies; for what I have reported of the Melting of the Plate, and the raiſing of the Money twice within theſe ſix years laſt, is confirmed by thouſands of French People here from <hi>Paris,</hi> and other Towns. And then the Noveliſts add, that the Farmers of the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions find Money at 8 <hi>per cent.</hi> Intereſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the King, which cannot be true of any conſiderable Sum, becauſe the ſame Farmers 20 and 30 years ago, did give more Intereſt for it, ſometimes 10, and 12 or 14 <hi>per cent.</hi> 'Tis well known, that whoſoever has any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>France</hi> now, does conceal it. 'Tis certain alſo, and confirmed from all parts, that they force all Men for the War, and that they want Horſes, and muſt get them from Foreign Countries.</p>
               <p>We have many amongſt us who are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>France,</hi> very near of the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with the Soldiers who beſiege a ſtrong Place; They heard in the beginning of the Siege, that the Engineers aſſured that the Place could not hold out beyond ſuch a certain time; when they have been a month, or ſome time longer before the Place, without carrying the Out-works, and that they ſee the Enemies make vigorous Sallies, they ſay, The Engineers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60783:94"/> do impoſe upon us, we ſhall never take the Place, the Garriſon is too numerous, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their vigour, that they ſuffer no want. Thus they ſpeak, tho' the Beſieged at the ſame time want all things, and the Place is turned to an heap of Rubbiſh by the Canon, Bombs and Carcaſſes, and the Garriſon half deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But notwithſtanding the great diſtreſs the Beſieged are in, they ſet a good face on their ſad condition, and make Sallies more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly than ever they did, to try whether by an extraordinary Effort they can get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of that trouble, and create in the Enemy a good Opinion of their condition, and oblige them to Raiſe the Siege, or in order to make a more Advantagious Capitulation. The Soldiers indeed would thereupon be of Opinion, that the Siege ſhould be Raiſed; but the General and Engineers, who beſt know the condition of the Place, and of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, go on with their Attacks vigorouſly, and it comes to paſs that ſoon after, the Garriſon being exhauſted in Sallies, capitulates, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body is amazed to find both the Place and the Garriſon in ſuch a deſolate condition, and admire how they did hold ſo long.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who ſaid ſix or ſeven years ago, that <hi>France</hi> would not be able to reſiſt the Allies, were much in the right, for they underſtood it in a rational ſenſe, but not abſolutely; that is to ſay, their meaning was, that it could not reſiſt them without the utter Ruine of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60783:94"/> Kingdom, for otherwiſe in point of Political Prudence and Government of Nations, 'tis not a commendable Reſiſtance, but a meer folly, to deſtroy a Nation, rather than to beg Peace, and yield ſomething, or reſtore what the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my juſtly demands.</p>
               <p>It was ſuppoſed that thoſe who Ruled in <hi>France</hi> had ſome Prudence, and that they would ſuſpend their Deſign of the Univerſal Monarchy to another time, or at leaſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Glory and the Kingdom ſo much for a ſmall point of Honour, and a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which certainly will not turn to their Honour at laſt; whereas there is no State in Europe, and I dare ſay there is no Example in Ancient or Modern Hiſtory, of any Nation that has ſo long, and without neceſſity ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a War ſo diſproportionate to its own Strength, and ſo ruinous as this will be to <hi>France,</hi> before the Peace is made. The French muſt needs have ſome mighty Hopes of a great Revolution in this Kingdom, whereby they expect a conjunction of its Power with theirs, to accompliſh their great Deſigns of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Univerſal Monarchy, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the Proteſtant Religion. But ſo as we ſee that Court governs now, it may maintain the War two years longer, do yet abundance of miſchief, and aſtoniſh all the World by their great Efforts, becauſe they are abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all the Eſtates and Lives of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and have no more regard to them than
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60783:95"/> to ſo many Dogs. Tho' there has been but little Corn this year in <hi>France,</hi> and almoſt no Wine, nor Cider, and but little Salt, Silk, and Olives. Yet the Pope and the Jeſuits who foment the War, do not care for that, they loſe nothing by it, for they reckon that they cannot fail of being very great and potent, however things ſucceed, for if the French King, and K. <hi>James</hi> prevail, they will be Maſters of <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>France</hi> ſuccumbs, they hope to be more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and Potent in that Kingdom than ever, and that they ſhall have nothing to fear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after from it.</p>

               <head>CHAP IV. How, and in what manner the <hi>French</hi> King has devoured three-fourths of all the Capital Stock of the Kingdom of <hi>FRANCE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST,</hi> The Lands and Houſes taken in general, thro' the Kingdom, are not, one with another, worth above the third part of what they were worth 30 years ago, in clear Money, repairs and amendments being allowed, and all other Expences diſcounted, and even that third part is ill paid. For altho' it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps well paid in ſome parts of the Kingdom, and that Eſtates about the Frontiers may not have diminiſhed in value; becauſe the Corn
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60783:95"/> and other Fruits ſell well there, by reaſon of the Armies and Garriſons, notwithſtanding if we conſider the great number of Lands untilled, and of Houſes forſaken, the Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trade, Scarcity of Money, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Deſtruction of above half the Working-Men, which is the cauſe of the want of Farmers, and Husband-Men; I ſay, if we duly conſider all this, we cannot but believe, that Real-Eſtates are fallen at leaſt two-thirds, as to the Rent; and that if one had a mind to ſell the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd, it would not yield the ſixth part of what it was worth formerly. So that 'tis a true poſition, that the King has devoured above three quarters of the Stock.</p>
               <p>He has alſo conſumed the three fourths of all the Woods for Timber, belonging to his Subjects, (except thoſe that pertain to the Clergy) becauſe the Extream Poverty they have been reduced to by the Government, has forced them to ſell them for the payment, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Taxes or Debts, or for their own Maintenance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King has likewiſe conſumed the three-quarter parts of the Coined Money in the Kingdom, conveying it out of the ſame by hundred different ways.</p>
               <p>He has likewiſe waſted the three-quarter parts of all the Plate and Jewels in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>He has done the ſame in reſpect of Houſhold-Goods; for altho' there may be almoſt as much
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60783:96"/> as formerly (except Cattle, Plate, and Jewels) their Species being not properly deſtroyed or conveyed out of the Kingdom; nevertheleſs, if they were to be ſold, they are not worth the fourth part of what they were formerly, becauſe none wants them, Money and People being gone.</p>
               <p>Men being deſtroyed, and Land-Eſtates for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, it follows neceſſarily that <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. has alſo devoured the greateſt part of the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and indeed, there is no need of them upon a forſaken Land, where there is no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for to what purpoſe? and who ſhould take care of them? Moreover, 'tis certain, that where there is yet ſome Cattle, they are not in the ſame quantity, nor ſo good as formerly; and ſuppoſe there were ſtill great multitudes of Cattle in the Kingdom, who ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them at work, or eat them as Meat, when above half of the Grown and Working-men are deſtroyed, as I have ſaid already, and ſhall prove it elſewhere: If the Cattle were plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, it would follow that they ought to be cheap, becauſe of ſcarcity of People. But we hear to the contrary, that Butchers-Meat has been dearer at <hi>Paris</hi> for ſome years paſt than before, tho' Money is ſcarcer, and the number of Eaters leſſer. The reaſon of it is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that the number of People is not ſo much diminiſhed in <hi>Paris</hi> as in the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are hardly capable to furniſh <hi>Paris</hi> with Meat, becauſe they are Untilled and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60783:96"/> beſides, the Land-Forces in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> being always very numerous and ſojourning, in ſo much exhauſted Countries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire abundance of Proviſions. This dearneſs of Meat is a ſenſible effect of the great Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of the Kingdom, eſpecially if joyned with the ſcarcity of Money. As for Horſes and Mules, but eſpecially Horſes, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them has decreaſed very much, becauſe, for many years, there is ſcarce any body has been able to keep Horſes and Mares for breed, becauſe of the want of Means, what profit ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there may be at preſent by that Trade, becauſe of the dearneſs of Horſes. 'Tis known the War has deſtroyed almoſt all of 'em.</p>
               <p>The King has ſwallowed up all the debts of the Wealthy Ones in his Kingdom, that is to ſay, all that was owing them for Money lent to private Perſons, for which the Lands, Houſes, Offices, Cattle, and Houſhold-Goods of the Borrowers, were mortgaged; Since the ſame Lands, and Houſes and the reſt, are come to nothing. Which amounts perhaps to more than the preſent value of all the Stocks in the Kingdom, as I ſaid already.</p>
               <p>He has devoured all the Civil Offices and Charges in the Kingdom, which he ſold very dear; ſo that they were inſtead of a Capital Stock to the Proprietors, whereas now they yield almoſt nothing to the Officers, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, cannot be ſold for the ſixth part of what they were bought for. For
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60783:97"/> altho' the Office of a <hi>Maſter of Requeſts,</hi> or of a <hi>Counſellor in the Parliament of Paris,</hi> may be ſtill ſometimes ſold for the half of what they did coſt at firſt; 'tis not ſo in the Provinces, where the Places of Councellor in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Courts of Judicature, called <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaux,</hi> as at <hi>Poictiers</hi> and <hi>Angers,</hi> are expoſed to Sale for four thouſand Livers at preſent, which had coſt formerly above forty thouſand Livers.</p>
               <p>He has alſo conſumed the Eſtates belonging to Towns, Corporations, and to great numbers of private Perſons, who did poſſeſs them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, by the Re-union that he has made of them to his Demain.</p>
               <p>He has devoured all the Magazines of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes in the Kingdom, which uſed to be well ſtored, but are now empty; I mean not only thoſe of Foreign Commodities, but alſo thoſe of Home-Manufactures and Product, ſo that no body dares to meddle with Trade, for fear he ſhould be preſently ſwallowed up by Taxes, if he did but ſhew himſelf to have any Wealth.</p>
               <p>He hath eat up the Stock of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Companies, which are juſt upon the point of being totally ruined.</p>
               <p>He has eat up the Value of all the Trading-Ships in his Kingdom, which are for the moſt part uſeleſs, and lie rotting in the Harbours.</p>
               <p>He has deſtroyed all the Manufactures in his Kingdom, which were an ineſtimable Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60783:97"/> nay, what is worſe, his Enemies have appropriated them to themſelves, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them.</p>
               <p>He has ſwallowed up at ſeveral times, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds of Millions of Livers which he extorted now and then from thoſe they call <hi>Partiſans,</hi> who are the Farmers of the Impoſts, whom he deſpoiled at laſt, after they had deſpoiled others.</p>
               <p>He has borrowed Immenſe Sums of Money from his Subjects, which he is not able to pay, if he were willing to do it.</p>
               <p>Finally, He has conſumed above the half of his People, if not in number, at leaſt in value; as I have ſaid already, and promiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate hereafter.</p>
               <p>So that, every one may ſee, that I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to ſay, that the Kingdom is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within theſe 30 years, more than the three fourths in Value, but ſpecially ſince the eight laſt years of the War: And I dare ſay, that this War does ſo much prejudice to it, that it amounts to near two thouſand Millions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers every year, one with another.</p>
               <p>And ſince I have advanced my ſelf ſo far, I muſt ſhew, how the thing may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſed already the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> might be worth near 30 Millions Sterling of Revenue, or about 400 Millions of Livers, in Real and Perſonal Eſtate, when the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, as <hi>England</hi> is valued at this day at ſixteen
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60783:98"/> Millions Sterling, or 208 Millions of Livers Revenue, in Eſtates Real and Perſonal.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſed alſo, that the Revenues or Profits of the Induſtry of the People of <hi>France,</hi> might be worth about 45 Millions St. or 600 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Livers yearly, as thoſe of the Engliſh Nation may be valued at this day, at 26 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions Sterling, or near 240 Millions of Livers. And ſo all <hi>France,</hi> with all its Effects, of which the People is the principal, might produce about 1000 Millions of Livers of Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue or profit; which being valued at 20 years purchaſe, ought to be worth 20 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Millions for the Stock; the People taken in bulk being as perpetual in duration as Lands, and Lands being worth nothing without Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>So that the Real and Perſonal Eſtates in <hi>France</hi> yielding 400 Millions of Livers yearly rent; if we eſtimate them upon the foot of 20 years purchaſe, they had been worth 8 thouſand Millions of Livers.</p>
               <p>Now if what we have ſuppoſed alſo be true, that the Real Eſtates taken in general, cannot be ſold after the Peace, tho' made to morrow, at the 4th part of what they were valued at 30 years ago; and that the Perſonal Eſtates be fallen the ſame proportion, it will make ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Millions loſs on thoſe Eſtates alone.</p>
               <p>As for the People, ſuppoſing that 4 Millions and a half of Souls have periſhed within theſe 30 years, half of which were Adult Men, if
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60783:98"/> we value them only at 80 Piſtols <hi>per</hi> head one with another, tho' Men are worth more than the double of that Sum, it would make near 4000 Millions of Livers loſs upon that Head.</p>
               <p>Nor can we reckon leſs than four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Millions of Livers for the Decreaſe in Price and Value of the remaining People that is, of the nine Millions of Souls ſuppoſed to be remaining in <hi>France,</hi> the greateſt part of which conſiſts in Women, and other ſorts of People more unprofitable ſtill for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Work, <hi>viz.</hi> Children, Old, Infirm, Lame, Sickly People, and Soldiers, and Men who by their Eſtates, Dignity and Profeſſion are exempted from working. For it holds conſtantly true, that the Value of People in a Nation depends upon that of their Induſtry and Labour, and on the Fruits and Profits proceeding therefrom, or to ſpeak more plain, the Value of a Nation depends upon the quantity of the Revenue, which the Real and Perſonal-Eſtate do uſually yield, which proceed from the Men, without which both Real and Perſonal-Eſtates are unprofitable, and Labour comes to nothing; for the Labour of a thin People in a vaſt and depopulated Country, yields very little profit. For example, the labour of a Million of Souls which may be at this day in <hi>Ireland,</hi> would not yield ſo much Profit as that of 200 thouſand in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> imployed about the ſame kind of work, altho' the Ground is as good or better in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:60783:99"/> and that million of Souls valued, and conſidered as bound to ſtay for ever in <hi>Ireland,</hi> would not be ſo much eſtimated by them who underſtand the Value of a People, as 200 thouſand People of the ſame Order in <hi>England</hi> living conſtantly in it: 'Tis not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that there is between an <hi>Iriſh</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> nor the difference between the Soils, that would produce ſuch an Effect; but the difference between a Populous Country and one ill Peopled. For if that Million of <hi>Iriſh-people</hi> was tranſplanted into <hi>England,</hi> they would be valued as much as a Million of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> of the ſame ſort; and even conſidering that <hi>England</hi> would thereby become more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous than is at preſent, they would make the Revenues of <hi>England,</hi> and the value of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and of its Induſtry riſe, and conſequently their own Value ſhould alſo riſe in the ſame proportion. On the contrary, if two hundred thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> did go over to <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſtay there, their Value and Price would decay very much (tho' they might, as to their private Intereſt, fare perhaps better there) becauſe of their leaving a more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Country for another that is leſs populous, but if inſtead of 200 thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> 2 Millions were tranſported thither, then they might be worth as much as they were in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> would be then as populous proportionably, as <hi>England</hi> is at this day, and <hi>Ireland</hi> would alſo be worth as much
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60783:99"/> in a little time proportionably, as <hi>England;</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney would ſoon be plentiful; Husbandry, Arts, Manfactures, Trade flouriſh there, as they would proportionably decay in <hi>England.</hi> Therefore we cannot reckon leſs than 4 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions for that Article.</p>
               <p>So that it appears, that 14 thouſand Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the 20 thouſand which the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> might be worth 30 years ago are loſt, I make a great allowance to <hi>France,</hi> for I am of opinion that the loſs is greater, and that the Real and Perſonal Eſtates, together with all the People in that Kingdom, are not worth 6 thouſand Millions of Livers, nor ſcarcely 4, the People being ſo much decreaſed. I own indeed, That if the People were collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and compacted in one half of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and forſook the other half; the 9 Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Souls would be worth as much as ever they were; and that if they were confined to the 4th. part of the Kingdom ſecure from all all Invaſion and inſult of Enemies, and placed near the Sea, they would be worth more than ever were all the 13 Millions and a half of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diffuſed thro' <hi>France</hi> 30 years ago, and that 4th. part of the Kingdom being well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd and cultivated, it would be infallibly worth more than was ever the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>So that it is a great imprudence in any Prince or Nation to extend their Conqueſts, unleſs they People inſtead of depopulating their Country thereby, as they uſually do; If ſo be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60783:100"/> they had Authority enough to do it: It were more wiſely done to recollect all their People in as narrow a Compaſs as they reaſonably could, in a good ground nigh the Sea and great Rivers; and to intrench themſelves round about, with natural and artificial For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, the beſt they could againſt all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults. Then they ſhould ſee their People thrive and increaſe every day in riches and ſtrength,</p>
               <p>We ſee by the Example of <hi>Holland,</hi> what a great People in a little Country may do. And by the Examples of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> how little a large Country ſignifies when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated. We may ſee it alſo, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Ireland.</hi> The firſt is but twice as big as the other, and not naturally ſo fruitful; and yet 'tis commonly eſtimated to be worth ten times more, becauſe of its being more populous. For if <hi>England</hi> enjoys a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Trade, if Arts and Manufactures flouriſh in it, and if Money is more plentiful, it owes all thoſe advantages to the multitude of its People, which is the main thing in which it ſurpaſſes <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read in a very good Book,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>VVill. Petty</hi>'s Political Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> that all the Lands and Houſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were valued in 1641. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rebellion at 11 Millions Sterling, and that 11 years after when the War was over, it was eſtimated in time of Peace at no more than a Million Sterling, and yet there was above 2 thirds of the People left, which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60783:100"/> were in it before the War; and it was alſo known that above 100 thouſand Souls that fled out of the Kingdom becauſe of the War, were preparing to return, as they really did. That ſame Book affirms, that the Houſes and Lands might then all have been bought for 1 Million Sterling: And yet no body was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that great numbers of new <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Inhabitants were preparing to tranſplant themſelves thither, as they did to the number of above 100 thouſand Souls in a few years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>So that the Real Eſtates in <hi>Ireland</hi> fell from 11 to 1, whereas the Real Eſtates in <hi>France</hi> according to my computation, are fallen only 3 fourths, from 8 to 2. But I am ſure, that they could not be ſold at that rate, and it may be not at the 10 part of what they were valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at formerly. And as I obſerved juſt now, there were left in <hi>Ireland</hi> above 2 third parts of the People which were in it before the War, including thoſe who fled over to <hi>England</hi> for ſhelter, and were expected back every day. Beſides the new Plantations of <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> which were a coming; whereas in <hi>France</hi> there is periſhed above half the People in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, not to ſay any thing of thoſe whom the War continues to deſtroy till it be finiſhed, and there is little reaſon to hope for any new Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Colonies to repeople it, neither is it certain that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who have been ſo cruelly perſecuted contrary to the publick
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60783:101"/> Faith of the Edicts, will ever return thither, and if they do, their number is not conſiderable enough to make up the great diminution of People.</p>
               <p>It would be to no purpoſe to ſay, that the <hi>Iriſh-War</hi> was inteſtine, and that both Armies did deſtroy alike Men, Houſes, Cattle, &amp;c. Whereas <hi>France</hi> makes War upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Allies. For I dare confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that no Civil War, how cruel ſo ever, and tho' managed with 2 big Armies in the middle of <hi>France,</hi> could ever have done ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Nation, as the King and his Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have done, and there needs no other proof of it but this, that there has periſhed in <hi>France</hi> much more People proportionably theſe laſt eight years, than there did in the eleven years War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though the Plague and Famine, which are the ordinary Companions of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Civil War, deſtroyed many more People in <hi>Ireland</hi> than the Sword did The Civil Wars of <hi>France</hi> in the laſt Age laſted above 40 years, and not the 4th part of the People periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, as have done within this 8 years.</p>
               <p>Then for the Houſes, they are not in a very good condition at preſent in <hi>France;</hi> but what ſignifies Houſes when a Nation is irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſtroyed? <hi>France</hi> has not much reaſon neither to boaſt of the goodneſs of her Cattle, which are very bad, and but few in number.</p>
               <p>But then, in the laſt place, I anſwer, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' all Houſes and Cattle had been deſtroyed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60783:101"/> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which they were not, ſince the Houſes in walled Towns, which is the chiefeſt thing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had ſuffered but little damage, and that the Cattle were ſtill numerous enough as appears by the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of that time; tho' I ſay, all what is alledged, were true, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that there being Men in it, they were capable of ſoon having Houſes and Cattle. And 'twere better for <hi>France</hi> that her greateſt Grievance, were to have her Houſes reduced to Aſhes, and all her Cattle deſtroyed, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that ſhe had but the two thirds of the Workmen, which were in her before the War, with a better Government and a better Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For if that were the Caſe, they would ſoon have as many Houſes and Cattle as they needed.</p>
               <p>It would be to as little purpoſe for any man to ſay, that it was becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> had not full Liberty for Trade. For the Iriſh Nation was better treated by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than the People of <hi>France</hi> has been by their Prince for many Reigns. And as for Trade, they had it always very free, and without any reſtraint upon Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who would come and fetch their Commodities, or upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves, who were at Liberty to carry them over to <hi>Spain, France, Portugal,</hi> and other places. Their Government was the ſame then as now, and yet their Eſtates are more valued at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, than they were at that time; which ſhews that it was meerly the effect of the war,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60783:102"/> and of the great deſtruction of Men which preceeded it.</p>
               <p>It would be as impertinent to object, that they were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who did then put ſuch a low-eſtimate upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe they had a mind to quit it, for beſides what I have ſaid already upon that Subject, the Objection is refuted by the Hiſtory, which informs us that there were above 100 thouſand <hi>Proteſtants</hi> born in that Country who had no Eſtates in any other part of the World, and who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently were far from any thoughts to quit it; and were expected there, beſides above an hundred thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch Proteſtants</hi> who actually went thither.</p>
               <p>We muſt add to this, that it will be much harder to reſtore <hi>France</hi> to its former State, then it was to reſtore <hi>Ireland,</hi> in reſpect of the Lands, becauſe the moſt part of the Soil of <hi>Ireland</hi> is fit for Paſture, whereas the moſt part of <hi>France</hi> conſiſts in Arable Lands and Vines, which being untilled and quite rooted up, cannot be reſtored ſo eaſily. I have inſiſted much on that example of <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe I do not know any that agrees ſo well with the Condition that <hi>France</hi> is likely to be reduced to.</p>
               <p>I might very well have valued only the loſs of the People in <hi>France,</hi> and have forborn to make mention of Real and Perſonal Eſtates, for after all is ſaid, Eſtates are worth nothing without People, and if there was but one Man in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:60783:102"/> all the Eſtates would be worth no more than that Mans maintenance. So that I might have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the People which did ſpend a thouſand Millions of Livers yearly, 30 years ago, when they did make up, according to our ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the number of 13 Millions and a half. I might, I ſay, have eſtimated them on the foot of twenty years purchaſe, at twenty thouſand Millions. For altho' every individual Perſon is commonly eſtimated, but at 7 or 8 years purchaſe, becauſe they are mortal, a Nation which is conceiv'd to be as perpetual, as the world in its duration, as I already ſaid, may be very reaſonably valu'd at 20 years purchaſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo, ſuppoſe that half of it is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not as to the number, at leaſt as to their ſtrength and ability for work; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I ſay, ſuppoſed, it would alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to ten thouſand Millions of Livers, which ought to be deducted from the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Millions aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the remaining People are very thin in the Kingdom, diſperſed to and fro, and not united and compacted together, ſo as to help one another, and to improve their Land, the Seas and Arts to the beſt advantage, as if it were gathered together in half of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in the ſame proportion as it was when the 13 Millions and a half of Souls were living in it; for that reaſon the leaſt that can be abated of its former Value, will be five or ſix Millions; and ſo the Kingdom will be found
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60783:103"/> to have decayed 3 quarters at leaſt of its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Value, if taken according to what it might have been eſtimated at thirty years ago.</p>
               <p>And if any man will be at the pains to reckon the other Loſſes which the Kingdom has endured within theſe 30 years, he will find many thouſand Millions of Livers loſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>As for example, the 13 Millions and a half of People, ſuppoſed to have been in <hi>France</hi> 30 years ago, ought to have encreaſed about two Millions of Souls in 30 years time, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ordinary Progreſs of Generation, obſerved by Naturaliſts, which being valued upon the ſame foot as we eſtimated the reſt, had been worth 3 thouſand Millions, that is, about 1500 Livers <hi>per</hi> Head, one with another.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that the Adult Males, or Men in the prime of their Age, are commonly valued at twice as much as the reſt, as is to be ſeen by the example of Slaves bought at that rate; which by the way ſhews either the Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or the Misfortune of thoſe Princes or States which willingly, or forced by ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, fell their Subjects to other Nations, by Regiments or Companies, ſo cheap as many of 'em do.</p>
               <p>If we add to this, the Loſs of the <hi>Superlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,</hi> that is to ſay, of what a Nation gets, or improves above its Expence; for it muſt be known, that a populous and thriving Nation,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60783:103"/> grows continually richer and richer, or elſe it would be ſtill in the ſame condition that it was 200 years ago. I ſay, if we reckon that Loſs of the <hi>Superlucration,</hi> it would amount ſtill higher.</p>
               <p>And then further, if we could take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Loſſes the Kingdom has ſuſtained within this 30 years, and eſpecially ſince this War, in relation to the Revenues and Rents of all the Eſtates, and of the Revenues and Profits of the Induſtry and Labour of the People, which have been ſo ſtrangely decaying from year to year, this Head, with the precedent, would amount to ſome thouſands of Millions of Livers.</p>
               <p>And I will make bold to add, that in caſe the War continues yet three years longer at the ſame Charges and Expences to <hi>France,</hi> that I do not think all the Real Eſtates in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could be worth, if ſold, a thouſand Millions of Livers, nay perhaps not worth five hundred.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the longer the War continues, the more irrecoverably that Kingdom ſinks, and alſo the Value of all things in it, that is, as well of the remaining People, as of Lands, Houſes and Perſonal Eſtates, except Money, Plate and Jewels.</p>
               <p>And ſo that Kingdom loſes leſs in Value eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year now, than it did the firſt years of the War, becauſe Lands, People, and all things in it, were more valuable then than now. Tho' it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60783:104"/> ſpends as many Men as formerly, and loſes more in relation to the impoſſibility of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever reſtored to its former State, and of recovering it ſelf. A poor man, who has but a hundred pounds Eſtate, loſes leſs as to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Sum when he loſes fifty, than a man who has ten thouſand pounds does, when he loſes one thouſand, but he loſes more in truth, becauſe he has not ſo much remaining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to live.</p>
               <p>And as a Man decays more by letting ſix Ounces of Blood when in a Conſumption, than he did when in health by letting 12 Ounces. So does <hi>France</hi> alſo loſe more now in that ſenſe than it did before.</p>
               <p>But becauſe People will be apt to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict all this, and that indeed the thing ſeems incredible, tho' grounded upon very good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that <hi>France</hi> ſhould have decayed ſo much. I conſent, that they ſhould value <hi>France</hi> ſtill at the half of what we ſuppoſed it was worth twenty years ago. But as for my part, I ſhall not be of their Opinion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. A particular Account of the Depopulation of <hi>FRANCE.</hi>
               </head>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>THE better to judge of the Depopulation and Decay of <hi>Agriculture</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as alſo of the Decreaſe of Arts, Manufactures, and Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the little probability there is, that that Nation ſhould ever recover its former Strength, or at leaſt not in 100 years time. The better, I ſay, to judge of this, let us remember the number of Inhabitants which we ſuppoſed to have been in <hi>France</hi> 30 years ago, <hi>viz.</hi> 13 Millions and a half. And let us conſider what number of Adult Men there might be in that time who were able to ſerve in <hi>Arts, Manufactures, Agriculture, Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. and what number of thoſe may have periſhed by the accidents we ſpoke of, beſides thoſe who are uſed to dye naturally; What number may be in the Army; What deficiency there may have been in the ordinary courſe of Propagation, for theſe thirty years paſt. How many there may be among the Adult, who are rendred unfit for Work, by their Eſtates, Dignity or Profeſſion; How many who are diſabled by natural Infirmities; and let us dive as much as poſſible into the number of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60783:105"/> them who are fit for Work, and Manufactures.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will ſuppoſe <hi>gratis</hi> for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>France</hi> (tho' there is reaſon to queſtion it) that there might be as many Men as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men 30 years ago; and that, dividing the whole Maſs of People in the Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> Men, Women and Children, into three parts, there was 4 Millions and a half of Men, from 12 years of age and above. That which induces me to comprehend in this diviſion, Children of 12 years and above, is, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there could not be in the whole, the third part of Men, ſince the Children in a Nation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 16 years of age, are commonly judged to make half of the whole Maſs of People; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they begin at that age to be uſeful for <hi>Arts, Agriculture, Navigation,</hi> &amp;c. and now they make Soldiers of them at that age in <hi>France,</hi> putting them in Garriſon, where they are by degrees inured to Fatigue and War. So that there is reaſon enough to think, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding among Adult Men, Children above 12 years of Age, I allow a great addition to the number of Men in <hi>France.</hi> And I deſire it may be remembred, becauſe my increaſing the number of Men, by the Addition of ſome hundreds of thouſands, will ſerve to ſhew more clearly and unqueſtionably the want of Culture of Lands, Trades and Arts in the Kingdom, becauſe that addition will ſhew the remaining part of them to be ſo much the leſs conſiderable.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:60783:105"/>
                  <p>From the year 1666. to the firſt of this War, there could be no leſs than 2 Millions of Souls diminiſht for the reaſons propoſed above, <hi>viz.</hi> The horrid and exceſſive Taxes impoſed every year upon the People, and the oppreſſive Methods of raiſing them, which are no leſs troubleſom than the Taxes themſelves; The unneceſſary Wars, the Conqueſts made to no purpoſe, which Depopulated the Country every way, as well by the Deſtruction of great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Men, as by the tranſplantation of an infinite multitude of Perſons, who retired to the new Conqueſts, hoping to live there more quietly than they could have done in their own oppreſſed Country; By the extreme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty which cauſed great numbers to periſh at home, and in the Hoſpitals of <hi>Paris,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; The Perſecution of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which, beſides the number of People deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby in <hi>France,</hi> baniſhed great numbers of 'em out of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I might juſtly reckon above two Millions of Souls diminiſhed by all thoſe ſeveral Methods, without any ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, of which above the third part were Men I mean, without including in that number, thoſe who dyed according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, whoſe number under moderate Governments, is ſupplied by Young Children, born in their ſtead. Let us reckon only 700 thouſand Men.</p>
                  <p>Since the beginning of this War, which hath laſted already eight years, the King maintains,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60783:106"/> as we have ſeen, about 500000 Men, of which the fourth part periſhes every year, one with another, as appears by the Liſt of Recruits. Nay, 'tis affirmed, that one third part dies or deſerts every year, but I ſhall reckon only a fourth part; That's above 900 thouſand in eight years paſt, without including this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent year, which being added to the 500 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand (including Servant men, and thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Artillery, Ammunition, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Militia) that are always kept on foot by Land or Sea, who are more than unprofitable to the Nation, make up the number of 1400 thouſand Men.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, there have died in theſe 8 years of the War, at leaſt the fourth part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Mortality, Miſery and Famine, ſince it is computed, that in the year of the Grand Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine alone, there periſhed two Millions and a half of People, not including thoſe deſtroyed in the War, or dead in the ordinary and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way. I know that ſome may cavil at the word <hi>Natural,</hi> becauſe very few die ſo now a-days in <hi>France;</hi> the common People dying for the moſt part meerly for want. Let us count only two Millions and a half of People for that Article, that we may not be accuſed of aggravating, and ſuppoſe that amongſt that number, there be but 500 thouſand Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are proportionably fewer Men than Women in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>It will make up above two Millions one
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60783:106"/> hundred thouſand Men that have died out of the four Millions and a half ſuppoſed above, beſides the five hundred thouſand Soldiers who are more than unprofitable, as I ſaid, for the National work, and who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for theſe eight years in the Armies at Land and Sea, or in Garriſon and Quarters, not including in that number them who dye in the ordinary courſe of Nature, which we ſuppoſe here <hi>gratis</hi> to be filled up by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary progreſs of Generation. So that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only 1 Million 900 thouſand Men in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>According to this Computation which is modeſt, there cannot be much above 8 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Souls remaining in the Kingdom, tho' I am willing to allow it yet 9 Millions, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the Soldiers; if we come now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the great number of thoſe 1900000 Men remaining, that are unfit for Work, we ſhall yet be much more amazed to find ſo ſmall a number of Working-men left in the Kingdom. Thoſe unprofitable Men make up almoſt the half of the total, as I ſhall demonſtrate by and by.</p>
                  <p>Of this ſort I account Church-men, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Judicature, Finances, and Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and all other Officers of what Order and denomination ſoever. The Farmers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular of all the Impoſitions, their Commiſſioners and Agents great and ſmall, and thoſe called <hi>Gabeleurs,</hi> and other Tools
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60783:107"/> which ſerve under them; all the Nobility and Gentry, from the Princes of the Blood, to the ſmalleſt of thoſe called <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> which are the pooreſt ſort of the Nobility; the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Chirurgions and Apothecaries; all the chief Merchants, and others who ſell things by retail, which they do not make themſelves, and ſeveral other kinds of men which I ſhall ſpecifie hereafter, with their Sons and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; I mean generally, all thoſe Orders of men who do not work in Manufactures, Mines, Agriculture, Navigation, Fiſhing, or any ſort of Arts. For it muſt be obſerved, tho' all theſe People are not wholly unprofitable to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, yet all their Labour cannot ſave Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from ſtarving. All thoſe kinds of men, if they were 20 times more numerous, can neither maintain nor enrich the Nation in the leaſt. The Labour of a Plough-man, or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Manufacturer of Trades-man, brings more Profit to the Common-wealth, than a thouſand of thoſe ſorts of men, except as to the matter of Propagation. Many of them indeed get great Fortunes, but it is juſt as with Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who win it from their Country-men, or Fellow Citizens. The Common-wealth is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Pin the richer for it, becauſe they add no Riches to them that were already in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I grant that Humane Society cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without men of that kind, and that they are ueceſſary in a certain meaſure; but it is not they who maintain or enrich a Nation. I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60783:107"/> confeſs indeed Merchants are neceſſary, and contribute much towards the Welfare of a Country, but 'tis by employing Working-men who are their Arms and Hands.</p>
                  <p>Moreover 'tis obſervable, that amongſt thoſe who do the moſt uſeful Work of the Nation, the ſtrongeſt and ſtouteſt are taken for War, and 'tis they eſpecially who for the moſt part loſe their Lives in it; ſo that among the men remaining in the Country, a great number are old, weak, infirm and invalid, which cauſes the difference of a ſixth part at leaſt, ſo that in caſe 900 thouſand Working-men are ſtill remaining, they muſt be reckoned only for 750 thouſand. For beſides that, I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted amongſt the Men, Children of twelve years, and the old Men above ſixty, who are not ſo fit for Labour, as other men. I count alſo among them, as I have ſaid already, the ſickly, blind, lame, and beggars, which make a great number. So that here remains only to the Value of 750 thouſand Adult men for all the Work of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>This one thing is alſo to be remembred, that the 500 thouſand Men in the Armies, do migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily diſturb other Subjects in their Work, by their Marches, Counter-marches, Sojournings, Quarters, and Robberies; for I beg the Reader to conſider what diſturbances ſuch a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Forces that have been marching conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually theſe 8 years from one end of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the other, from one Province, Frontier,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60783:108"/> or Sea-Coaſt to the other, by a hundred diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Roads, and committing Diſorders every where, for want of Money to pay their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, beſides their Robberies, in which they are countenanced by the Court, becauſe the Soldiers are kept ſhort in their Pay; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they think fit to indulge them, that they may make new Levies, and Recruit their Armies the more eaſily.</p>
                  <p>Add to all this, the Diſorder cauſed by the oppreſſive Methods of Raiſing Impoſts and Taxes, of which I ſpoke already.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, of the ſaid 750 thouſand Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-men, many are continually-employed in things relating to the Armies, ſerving now and then as Pioneers on the Frontiers, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten employed about carrying to Garriſons or Armies, Ammunition, Proviſions, and other neceſſaries for their Subſiſtence, either with Horſes and Mules, or VVaggons by Land, or with Ships or Boats by Sea and Rivers without mentioning the Oppreſſions formerly ſpoken of, which they lie under from Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, Exacters, and Clergy-men.</p>
                  <p>And this is alſo to be remembred here, that beſides <hi>Sundays</hi> they have many falſe Holy days, as already ſaid, which deprives them of the 6th. part of the working days in the year, ſo that the 750 thouſand men are not worth 600 thouſand, who work all thoſe days, as <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> do in <hi>England;</hi> without mentioning like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their ſorry Cattle, and the incapacity
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60783:108"/> they are in of improving their induſtry to the beſt advantage, by being ill maintained, and wanting means and tools neceſſary for it.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe things being duely conſidered, I dare affirm that 500 thouſand men in the prime of their Age, as Souldiers commonly are, being in good health, not moleſted nor diſturbed in their labour, provided with all neceſſaries in their ſeveral, imployments, well fed, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to no other Holy days but Sundays, or ſome few days beſides, which are obſerved in <hi>England</hi> and ſome other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Countries, would be much more uſeful and ſerviceable to a Nation, than the 750 thouſand of which we ſpeak, lying under all the troubles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries above mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it appears, that the French King has in his Armies above the fourth Man of his Kingdom, and the half of all his Subjects able for Work: And 'tis evident that <hi>France</hi> loſes yearly by this Depopulation, and the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, above the Value of one of the largeſt and beſt Provinces of the Kingdom, and more than all its Conqueſts are worth.</p>
                  <p>Let's ſee now what part of thoſe Men may be employed about Husbandry, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny about Arts, Manufactures, Navigation, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Trade, in and out the Kingdom, and in the Shops. To avoid a hard and tedious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all the particulars of ſuch a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I think we may allow Husbandry the two Thirds of the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> 500 thouſand
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60783:109"/> Men, and to Arts, Navigation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the 250 thouſand remaining.</p>
                  <p>In this manner there being 27 thouſand Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in the Kingdom, there cannot be in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pariſh, one with another, above 20 Men employed about Husbandry.</p>
                  <p>And not above 10 out of the 250 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand employed in Arts, Manufactures, and the reſt, in every Pariſh of the Kingdom, one with another. But 'tis to be obſerved, there are no Husband-Men in Cities and Towns, and ſo the Country Pariſhes injoy the more.</p>
                  <p>And as on the other hand, there are very few Men imployed in the Country Pariſhes, about Arts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Cities and Towns have the greater number of them.</p>
                  <p>By Husbandry, I underſtand, all neceſſary labour about Lands, as well for the production of Fruits as Corn, Wine, and Cider, Pulſes, Roots, and Herbs, for the uſe of Mankind, Hay, Wood, Flax, Hemp, Apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the reaping and gathering of them all in their Seaſon, as alſo all Labour relating to breeding of Cattle, and its dependencies, as Wool, Milk, Butter, Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I comprehend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo therein, the Handy-Crafts, without which Husband-Men can do nothing. As alſothoſe that make or mend their Tools: And all ſuch whoſe work is to make their Cloaths and Shoes, and who now and then imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo about Husbandry.</p>
                  <p>No doubt but a great many will think the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60783:109"/> number of 500 thouſand for Husbandry to be very ſmall: And I am of that opinion my ſelf, for any body may eaſily conceive, that it is not ſufficient to Cultivate the half of the Kingdom: Nay I will ſay further, not to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the fourth part of it; as it ought to be done.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt add alſo, that Women, Maids, and Boys under 12 years of Age and above 7 do perform a great part of the work. 'Tis the Women that take care of the Cows, Hogs, Sheep, and other ſmall Cattle, or Beaſts; who make Butter, and Cheeſe; who ſpin Woollen and Linnen Thread, who go to Market, who help to Sow and Reap Corn, Wine, and other Fruits; and in the preſent great ſcarcity of Men, ſome drive Oxen or Horſes, dig Vines, and do other ſuch work; I grant they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do it ſo well nor ſo much as Men do, and that they cannot meddle with any ſuch thing, unleſs there be in one Family a great many luſty Women, for commonly they are buſie enough about Domeſtick Affairs, and the care of Children, and when they give ſuck or are quick with Child, they are fit for no kind of work.</p>
                  <p>But however, Women in general are very helpful to Men in Affairs of Husbandry; and now a days more than ever in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe of the want and ſcarcity of Men; beſides that, there's no queſtion but ſeveral of the poor Gentry, Curates and Prieſts, and poor Officers
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60783:110"/> of Judicature, Chirurgions, Notaries, Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, or Bailiſts, their Sons, and Servant-Men, work alſo about Husbandry to avoid ſtarving. And 'tis known that the Gentry and Clergy had always Servants, who were imployed in ſuch Affairs.</p>
                  <p>So that I believe there may be yet near the value of 30 Men fit for Husbandry in every Pariſh of the Kingdom, including the poor Gentlemen, Curats, Prieſts, and others, which I named juſt now, with their Servant-Men, without reckoning Women, Maids, Girls, and Boys above 7 years of Age, and under twelve. They may ſeem to be more numerous in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places, becauſe of many Weakly, Infirm, Blind, Lame People, and Beggars who appear there, beſides Boys from 12 to 16 years of Age, who do all of them ſomething; but of which two or three are ſcarce worth a Stout luſty workman And therefore I reduce them all to the value of 30 Men; and I am ſure, I allow them more Men than there are. But I confeſs, they loſe abundance of their time about the Offices, as I ſaid already, of Collectors, and other ſuch troubleſom buſineſſes, wherewith they are plagued: I confeſs alſo that in a great many Villages there is hardly a man to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>By Arts, as I ſaid already, I underſtand Handy-Crafts, Manufactures, Navigation, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Shop-keeping Trade, in Cities, and Towns. I excepted Merchants, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60783:110"/> thoſe that maintain Manufactures, and other wealthy Trades-Men, whether they ſell by whole ſale or retail, thoſe things which they made not themſelves, though very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a Nation, becauſe I place them elſewhere among thoſe who by their Eſtates are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from working.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſed there might be 250 thouſand of them in all. Amongſt that number, I judge, there may be the tenth part, who apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to things more for Curioſity, Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Vanity, than for Neceſſity; whoſe Induſtry nevertheleſs, is not to be contemned, eſpecially when it is uſeful to draw Money from Foreigners: ſuch for themoſt part are more regarded by great and rich Men, and all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Curioſities and Pleaſure, and commonly get great Fortunes ſooner than others that are more uſeful; as we ſee, that Princes ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prefer thoſe who are ſubſervient to their Luſts and Pleaſures; or of an outward Shape which pleaſes their Eyes, or are impudent in asking undeſerved Preferments, tho' never ſo uncapable, or without Merit, Honour or Affection to their Country; while thoſe who are modeſt and moſt capable, and zealous for the publick good, and the moſt deſerving of the Nation are neglected; and ſuffered to ſtarve, of which there are but too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Handy-Crafts moſt neceſſary to the Common wealth, are firſt, Thoſe whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60783:111"/> it is to get them Iron from the Mine, and to render it fit for <hi>Man's</hi> uſe; and then thoſe who imploy it, as Smiths and others who forge the Tools fit for Husbandry and Arts; and then the following Trades, as, Taylors, Carpenters, Maſons, Stone-cutters, Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, Lock-ſmiths, Glaziers, Paviers Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Shoemakers, Millers, Rope-makers, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Weavers, Cutlers, Coopers, Nail-makers, Tanners, Curriers, Cart-wrights, Potters, Salt-makers, Pewterers, Braziers, Pin-makers, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Bookſellers, Sword-cutlers, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, Gunpowder-makers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All thoſe who work about Wool, or Linnen, or Silk; all Manufacturers of any kind ſoever, who work not only to ſupply the wants of their Nation, but for the uſe of Foreign Countrys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One Man amongſt thoſe, as I ſaid already, is more uſeful than a hundred who buſie themſelves about unneceſſary things, nay, and often times noxious, as are ſubſervient for Luxury, Pride, Daintineſs, and even Wantonneſs, or ſometimes to Cheats, and Impoſtures, and who abuſe the Cuſtoms, Opinions and fooliſh Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the uſeful Handicrafts, thoſe who are ſerviceable for Navigation, for building of Ships, and all other things neceſſary for equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them, as alſo to Fiſhing, are not to be forgotten; and therein I do alſo comprehend all Sea-faring Men, under what denominations ſoever.</p>

                  <p>All theſe things being conſidered, there's no doubt but that number of 250 thouſand Men, which I ſuppoſed to be remaining in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> fit for Handicrafts, will be found very ſmall; But it is obſervable, that as about Husbandry, we may ſay alſo that about Arts, and Handicrafts, Women, Maids, Girls and Boys under twelve, and above ſeven years of Age, are very uſeful. They work about Wool, Linnen, Silk, and do ſeveral pretty and uſeful things: And even the Wives and Daughters of Men, who follow the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, either noxious or uſeleſs to Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and live in Towns; thoſe Females, I ſay, are more profitable than their Men, for either they Spin, or Sow with a Needle, or do ſome other neceſſary Work. Tho', I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that Country-women or Children, are commonly a great deal more uſeful than thoſe of the Profeſſions or Trades, that are exerciſed in Towns.</p>
                  <p>When all is ſaid, tho' Womens Labour is commonly judged to be a very inconſiderable matter in general, I dare ſay, it is ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that our Poſterity in <hi>France</hi> will ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel the want of it in 25 or 30 years hence, when the half or the two-thirds of Unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Women, who cannot find matches for want of Men, ſhall be dead without Children; then there will be much leſs People fit for Husbandry, and Arts; and Land-Eſtates will decay more and more for that reaſon, for 20 or 30 years hence.</p>

                  <p>All thoſe who are imployed in Boats upon Rivers, to carry Goods; or about Fiſhing, with their Sons and Servant-men.</p>
                  <p>Beſides ſeveral other ſorts of Men which I do not remember.</p>
                  <p>The number of theſe Men is certainly as great as is the number of thoſe imployed at this day, in Handicrafts, petty Trades, and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. There are indeed among all thoſe ſorts of them many who, as I ſaid before, are helpful to Agriculture, and do work now and then about Lands.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alſo to be obſerved, that the number of moſt of thoſe Men who are unprofitable to Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and Arts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before-mentioned, is much leſs diminiſhed than that of Peaſants, Artiſts, Manfacturers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the Extream Poverty and the Violence of the military Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have forced multitudes of them to turn Soldiers. VVhereas others for the moſt part, have avoided it, by reaſon they had ſomething whereupon to live; and 'tis known alſo, that the number of Civil Offices is prodigiouſly increaſed ſince this VVar, and by conſequence that of Civil Officers in proportion.</p>
                  <p>This is the reaſon why the People of Towns
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60783:114"/> are leſs diminiſhed proportionably than thoſe of the Country, tho' the former are alſo much diminiſh'd, and if ſo be the VVar continues two years longer, as it may happen, Peaſants and Artiſts will decreaſe much more in number than they have done hitherto, not only by the Sword, but alſo by the dreadful Poverty which will certainly overwhelm all thoſe that ſtay at home.</p>
                  <p>I make bold to ſay, that the fifth or ſixth part of the Clergy-men in <hi>France,</hi> would be ſufficient for the Nation, if things were well regulated; ſo that 190 thouſand of them, beſides ſeveral Servant-men who attend 'em, could eaſily be ſpared for Husbandry and Trade.</p>
                  <p>I ſay moreover, that the tenth part of the Officers of Judicature, would be ſufficient for all the Kingdom. VVe may alſo eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there are too many Officers of the Finances, and too many Farmers of the Impoſts, with all their Tools and Servant-men; too many Officers of the King's Houſhold and that the number of the new Offices is enormous; So that 'tis apparent, that the greateſt part of thoſe kinds of Men, with their Sons and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, might be a thouſand times better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about Husbandry and Trade, than in thoſe Offices, ſo ruinous and troubleſom to the Nation, while it wants ſufficient numbers of People to Cultivate the Ground and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Trade.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:60783:114"/>
                  <p>So that I think I have acquitted my ſelf pretty well of what I had taken in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> To demonſtrate, that above the half of Men are periſhed in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> within theſe 30 years: Seeing I have proved, by examining the Progreſſes of the Loſſes <hi>France</hi> has made in that reſpect, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but the value of 750 thouſand Men, fit for the profitable work of the Nation, inſtead of 4 Millions and a half which it might have had in all, 30 years ago; amongſt which I confeſs, there may be yet about a Million of other Men, but ſuch as are unprofitable, and even for the greateſt part troubleſom to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>I grant alſo, that beſides all thoſe ſorts of Men, <hi>France</hi> has a great multitude of Soldiers, as I ſaid before, who might be converted into Husband Men, and Artiſts, if they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to work after the Peace, in caſe the Kingdom be free from Civil troubles, but all thoſe together with the 750 thouſand profitable Men, and the unprofitable of which I have ſpoken, including all the Lame, Ancient, or Impotent People mentioned before; I ſay, all thoſe, though making about the half of the 4 Millions and a half, are not really worth the half of that number 30 years ago, becauſe there remains among them at preſent as many, or more Impotent Men, as there did 30 years ago, and not the third part of the Uſeful Men that were in that time, comprehending even in that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60783:115"/> number the 4 or 500 thouſand Soldiers, tho' noxious inſtead of being profitable, without which there would be but the fourth part of the number.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve alſo, that above 100 thouſand of the beſt Men, are to be deducted yet out of the 750 thouſand Profitable Men remaining, for the Recruits of the Armies this year, which is the 9th of the War, ſo that there will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main above 650 thouſand, and theſe too very much diſabled.</p>
                  <p>So that any man of ſenſe may judge by this of the preſent condition of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Criticks do their beſt to control my Calculations, and deny the number of <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to be ſo much decreas'd as I affirm it to be; let them aſſert, if they pleaſe, that not above the half of thoſe I call <hi>Profitable Men,</hi> have periſhed; yet whether they will or no, it will appear that more have periſhed of thoſe profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones, than are now remaining, and that of it ſelf would be ſufficient to juſtify what I have advanced in ſeveral places, <hi>viz.</hi> that Eſtates in <hi>France</hi> are not worth in general, above the third part of the Revenue they were worth 30 years ago, and perhaps not worth the 10th part as to the Stock.</p>

                  <head>The Effects of a Depopulation.</head>
                  <p>SOme may imagine, becauſe they do not underſtand nor comprehend thoſe things, that I exaggerate the Miſery of <hi>France,</hi> and the inconveniencies of her Depopulation; Therefore I ſhall ſhew here a part of thoſe. Evils which attend the Depopulation of a Country, which every one does not think of.</p>
                  <p>In a Depopulated Country, beſides that the Grounds lie untilled, the People become infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly lazy; there is no emulation amongſt them for VVork; no encouragement for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; and thus Arts, Manufactures, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Trade cannot flouriſh there; Money is neceſſarily ſcarce, or at leaſt it is not common, which hath the ſame Effect; the Intereſt of Money is very high, at 10, 12 and 15 <hi>per cent.</hi> which hinders all Commerce, and ruineth Manufactures and Arts; the Lands and Houſes are bought at 4 or 5 years purchaſe, or leſs, according to the degree of Depopulation. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets are far one from another, and People loſe all their time in going and coming; they that have any thing to ſell are obliged to keep it a great while, and to give it almoſt for nothing, becauſe of the ſmall number of Buyers, the ways are for the moſt part unpaſſable; Bridges or Paſſage Boats upon the Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not kept in repair, and many times there is none
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60783:116"/> at all, which hinders Communication from one place to another, or at beſt obliges People to travel a great deal more than is needful to arrive at the place whither they are bound. Navigable Rivers become oftentimes Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable for want of care, and neceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; Poſts, Coaches, Horſes, and Ferry-Boats are alſo wanting, becauſe no Body will be at the charge of them, where there's neither Trade nor People: Seditions can hardly be ſuppreſſed, when any powerful Neighbour does abet them, becauſe an Army cannot eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and the Publick Revenues are but ſmall in ſuch places. And 'tis alſo difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to maintain a conſiderable number of old Standing-Forces in ſuch Countries. Every body is diſcouraged from Building, Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Planting, by reaſon that People look on their labour as loſt, the Earth, Trees and Beaſts producing of themſelves almoſt as much as is neceſſary for the Inhabitants, without any trouble, as may be ſeen in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Men in a Depopulated Country cannot help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their VVork, nor aſſiſt one another almoſt upon any occaſion, becauſe of their remoteneſs. I would ask any Men, whether it be not true, that twenty thouſand Men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the building of a great City, would not do incomparably more work, if lodged all on three thouſand Acres near their Work, than if they lodged upon ten thouſand at a diſtance, where they ſhould not be able
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60783:116"/> to aſſiſt one another, nor communicate their Counſels together, but ſhould loſe moſt of their time in going and coming, or in doing nothing.</p>
                  <p>Thieves multiply in Depopulated Countries, and 'tis dangerous to travel in them; if it be in the Main Land, as <hi>France</hi> is, the number of Wolves and other miſchievous Beaſts, increaſes infinitely; f any man ſtands in need of a Prieſt, Chirurgion, Phyſician or Lawyer, how hard is it to find them? and how much time is there loſt in ſeeking after them, becauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſs? And as Arts want a mutual ſupply and ſupport one from another, they cannot be eaſily practiſed where there is few People, and where they live ſo far one from another; for that reaſon an able and skillful Artiſt is often forced to do himſelf what another Perſon very unskilful and ignorant of the Trade, and whoſe labour is not worth a penny a day, <hi>viz.</hi> either a VVoman or a Child, could eaſily do. In a Depopulated and thin Peopled Country, the charges of proſecution of Suits at Law, is greater than in a well Peopled One; and in ſuch Countries thoſe who have Eſtates, and are born for Peace are obliged to be their own Officers and Souldiers; and the charge and trouble of defending and guarding a Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated Country, againſt all Foreign Invaſion, is greater than in a Populous Country; there's great want of Hoſpitals for the Sick and Wounded, Orphans, Lame and Mad Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60783:117"/> There are no Houſes of Correction, or Diſcipline, or VVork-Houſes, for there is none either able or willing to be at the charges of them; in Maritime Countries the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of People is infinitely uſeful for equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with diligence great numbers of men of War and other Ships, to ſupply the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants with Convoys; there may be found in an inſtant all the neceſſaries for Navigation, if not in one place, yet in another very near; but it is the contrary in a thin peopled Country; The Sciences and Noble Arts cannot flouriſh in a Depopulated Land, becauſe the People muſt needs be poor there, and ſo that there is none to maintain the Univerſities, Academies, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Schools neceſſary to that purpoſe. The Adminiſtration of Civil Government, as well as of Juſtice, is more eaſie and leſs charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a well peopled Country than in one that is depopulated. Every one is obliged in a diſpeopled Country to have his Houſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly furniſhed with all ſorts of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a long time, like a Veſſel that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes a long Voyage, which occaſions a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er waſt of the ſame, beſides that they are not ſo good, or are ſooner ſpoiled, and that the owners forbear to ſell them, when they might do it to advantage, or are forced to lay out a great deal of Money in buying them, from which they might have a good Intereſt if it had been imployed elſewhere.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:60783:117"/>
                  <p>'Tis not eaſie to conceive the other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which ariſe from the Depopulation of a Country, into which <hi>France</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity fall, ſince it Labours already under them; but her Caſe will be a great deal worſe twenty years hence. I confeſs, as I inſinuated before, that if ſo be the remaining People in <hi>France,</hi> were united and compacted together in half of the Kingdom, forſaking the other half, to any that would have it; that Moeity ſo peopled, ſhould be worth as much as one half of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was 30 or 40 years ago, provided their Clergy-men, Lawyers and others, which we call unprofitable, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with thoſe that are more profitable, were reduced to a competent number. I ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſay further, That if ſo be the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the People of the Kingdom were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and gathered together in the fourth part of it, that fourth part ſhould be worth more, and would afford more Revenue than the one half of the Kingdom which ſhould have but the ſame number of Inhabitants; and I do verily think, that the fourth part ſo peopled, would be worth more than the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> ever was, provided they were ſituated as much as poſſible, by the Sea ſide. The Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> as I ſaid before, is but a ſmall Country, but extraordinary rich, becauſe it is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary populous; it is not ſo much as the 40th part of <hi>England,</hi> and yet may be worth about 4th part of it, tho' I believe it does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60783:118"/> above the 7th part of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom. And again, <hi>Spain</hi> is three times as big as <hi>England,</hi> and yet is not worth the third part of it; and <hi>Ireland</hi> being 20 times as big as the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> tho' provided with many good Sea-Ports, and a fruitful Soil, is not worth the third part of that Province, becauſe it is not peopled enough, no more than <hi>Spain:</hi> This I underſtand with regard to their reſpective Extent; for abſolutely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there are more People in <hi>Ireland</hi> and in <hi>Spain</hi> taken apart, than is in the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> there being above a Million of Souls in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there being apparently a leſſer number in <hi>Holland:</hi> As for <hi>Spain,</hi> there may be four or five times that number in it; ſo that it is not the multitude of People in a large Country, of a vaſt Extent, which makes the Kingdom rich and formidable, but ſuch a Number as is ſufficient, not only to Cultivate all the Lands which might and ought to be Cultivated in it, but alſo may furniſh great numbers of Men ſit to make a Nation flouriſh by Arts, Manufactures, Trade, Navigation and Fiſhing. Now 'tis evident, that <hi>France</hi> is very far from having all the People which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>The King and his Miniſters, who formed ſuch vaſt Projects upon the Number of that People, which to them ſeemed to be infinite, were guilty of a mighty miſtake. For <hi>France</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:60783:118"/> might and ought to have been two or three times as populous as it was.</p>
                  <p>Had the French Politicians been as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as they would make us believe them to have been, and as ſome fancy they really are, they ought to have applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, above all things, to increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the People, and not to make War againſt all the World, without Conduct or Judgment, nor to have extended themſelves in fooliſh and vain Conqueſts, as they have done for ſome time, by which they have diſperſed and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves. There is no Remedy at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for ſuch a Diſaſter, but if they were able to improve their unhappy Experience, they ought to abandon their Conqueſts ſpeedily, and reſtrict themſelves into a narrower compaſs, <hi>Virtus unita fortior,</hi> Virtue united is ſo much the ſtronger, as did the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of old,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Decretum factum de coercendo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra limites Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</hi> Tacit.</note> and even, if they would, after having done this, lay deſolate all their Frontier-Provinces, by their Abſolute Authority, and withdraw all the People in them with their Effects, and ſettle the ſame in the contiguous Maritime Provinces, as much as poſſible, and give them a Compenſation for what they loſt, the Prince and his Subjects would get infinitely by it.</p>
                  <p>I am confident, that inſtead of 82 millions of Acres that are contained, as I ſaid, in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> on which there are at
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60783:119"/> preſent but 9 millions of Souls, according to our former ſuppoſition, which is about 8 Acres for every Soul. I am confident, I ſay, and it can eaſily be demonſtrated, that 18 Millions of Acres would be ſufficient to maintain the ſaid 9 millions of Souls, and they ſhould even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves extraordinarily, their Induſtry, Arts, Manufactures, Trade, Navigation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſupplying them plentifully with all thoſe things which the Soil could not afford, provided the Government were moderate; and they would be as able in a little time to defend themſelves againſt all Enemies, and even to carry on the War againſt any Neighbouring Nation, as much and better than ever the <hi>French</hi> Nation was, if there were any neceſſity for it.</p>
                  <p>We ſee that in the Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> there is not above an Acre of Ground for every Soul, whereas I allow two to theſe; and 'tis probable, that in 7 or 8 of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England,</hi> in the midſt of which <hi>London</hi> ſtands, I mean the Country 50 miles round about that great City; 'tis probable, that there is not above 2 Acres of Land for every Soul living in that compaſs, which maintains per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps above 1500 thouſand <hi>Souls.</hi> I do not think that extent of Land to be above the 7th part of <hi>England;</hi> it were to no purpoſe to ſay, that the <hi>Sea</hi> and the reſt of <hi>England,</hi> do furniſh them with all neceſſaries, and with Proviſions. For it would be the ſame with that Maritime and populous part of <hi>France,</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:60783:119"/> as I ſaid already, which would alſo ſupply the Neighbours with thouſand other Commodities of its own.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Prognoſticks which may be drawn from the Depopulation of <hi>FRANCE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THAT the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> will not be worth ſo much as that of <hi>Spain,</hi> in caſe the War laſts two years longer, becauſe it will be more depopulated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Idleneſs, Ignorance, Superſtition, and all kind of Vices will overflow that Kingdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Induſtry, Skill in Arts and Sciences, Learning, good Breeding, and Knowledge of God, which ſome amongſt Papiſts did ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who tho' born in the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, did nevertheleſs deteſt both Pope and Maſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Uſages of <hi>France</hi> were compoſed for a well peopled Country, great inconveniences will ariſe from thence, unleſs they are altered, and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by degrees to the condition of that People.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Three parts of the Tribunals of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, great and ſmall, or the three parts of thoſe who compoſe them, muſt needs fall; as alſo three parts of the <hi>Generalities,</hi> (that is, the Offices of Treaſurers in the Provinces of <hi>France</hi>) <hi>Elections, Greniers a Sel, Courts of Aids, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60783:120"/> of Accompts,</hi> and all other Tribunals or Juriſdictions, muſt likewiſe fall, or the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Officers be reduced.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A great many ſmall Towns and Boroughs will come to nothing, and be abandoned to Batts and Owls, and forgotten as <hi>la Vallone,</hi> a Town in <hi>Normandy;</hi> a great part of Chief Cities in Provinces, and other middling Towns, will decay ſtrangely, and loſe ſome the three parts, ſome the half of their ſplendor.</p>
               <p n="6">6. VVhat confuſion and diſorder will not this produce in Cities or Towns, which are the Seat of Tribunals or Juriſdictions? all thoſe places, I ſay, will come almoſt to nothing. How many Families formerly wealthy, how many others ſubſiſting by their Means, will be ruined and brought to their wits end, by ſuch a change, when they ſee themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done without remedy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Rapperees</hi> and <hi>Banditi,</hi> together with VVolves and other Beaſts, will ſwarm in the Kingdom, that being the infallible Fate of all Depopulated Countries.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Kings Revenues, whether he will or no, and whether the Government changes or no, will decreaſe above the third part in four.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Some Lands, which were ſold formerly at 20 or 30 years purchaſe, will be ſold at four or five years purchaſe or leſs, and if ſo be the VVar continues two years longer, they will be worth nothing at all, but entirely left and forſaken in ſeveral Provinces of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:60783:120"/>
               <p n="10">10. As it will be more difficult to guard and defend the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> when depopulated, and as the Publick Revenues will be mightily decreaſed, ſo will Seditions and Inſurrections be more difficult to appeaſe and ſuppreſs, becauſe they will begin in places remote from Court, or in the richeſt and moſt populous parts of the Kingdom, and it may be near the Sea, where the Rebbels may be eaſily aſſiſted by ſome powerful Neighbour, while the Forces, commanded to ſuppreſs the Inſurrections, muſt come from far, and paſs thro' deſert places, where it will be hard to procure Proviſions for them, and erect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines; and this in all likelihood, will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion 'ere long a diſmembring of the French Monarchy, unleſs the Government be quite changed, and the People be eaſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of three parts of the Impoſſitions at leaſt; Let us ſuppoſe, for example, that <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> or <hi>Marſeille,</hi> which will be ſtill good Towns, and in all likelihood better than they are now, as we ſee, that notwithſtanding the great depopulation of <hi>Spain, Barcelonne, Seville,</hi> and <hi>Cadiz</hi> are ſtill good and rich Towns; Let us ſuppoſe, I ſay, thoſe Towns and ſome others remote from <hi>Paris,</hi> would demand a diſcharge from part of the Impoſitions paid by others, which they are like to do in all probability, and may thereby obtain Priviledges that will make them flouriſh; is it not probable that in caſe the King refuſes it, they will riſe, and keep
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60783:121"/> Correſpondence with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh?</hi> and then what can their King do in ſuch a diſtraction and weakneſs of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, the Provinces thro' which his Forces muſt come thither, and thoſe, where ſuch great Towns lie, being depopulated, except the parts adjacent to the ſaid Towns? How ſhall he be able to help himſelf if there be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in <hi>Bearn</hi> or <hi>Low-Brittany?</hi> The King will be forced for that very reaſon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Impoſitions all the Kingdom over, but eſpecially in Provinces and Places near the Frontiers: 'Tis like that the <hi>State Provinces, Provinces à Etats,</hi> as they call them, ſuch as <hi>Brittain, Languedock, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> which are governed for the moſt part by their own States, will deſire to be freed from the Uſurpations and Invaſions made upon their Rights and Priviledges in this Reign.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For the ſame reaſon it ſeems altogether impoſſible that Arbitrary Power can hold out any longer in <hi>France,</hi> when there is ſuch a decay in the French Monarchy; and ſo much the rather, becauſe of the Neighbourhood of ſeveral free and potent Nations which will probably Lord it over <hi>France</hi> in their turn, or at leaſt not be afraid of her as now, ſuch as the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Subjects in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> or in the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> amongſt which the <hi>French</hi> Subjects may retire, if oppreſſed for the future, or make an Inſurrection, and withdraw from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60783:121"/> the <hi>French</hi> Government, either by ſubmitting to another, or changing the form of their own; for the working ſort of 'em, when they ſee their Labour doth not avail them in <hi>France,</hi> and that elſewhere they may get three or four times as much a day, without any fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived by a Tyrannical Government of the fruits of their Induſtry, what a mighty temptation will it be for them to tranſplant themſelves thither? for we muſt conſider that the <hi>French</hi> People are reduced in a little time from a Flouriſhing Condition to a State of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Miſery, and that they remember that they were formerly more at eaſe; it muſt be alſo conſidered, that they have ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, are induſtrious, active and diligent, and love to work; So that ſeeing ſuch an amazing Alteration in the Kingdom, and that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to get their Livelihood by their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and hearing that <hi>England, Holland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and other Countries are in a proſperous and thriving condition, that all Stangers are welcom amongſt them, and enjoy perfect Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, there's no queſtion but they will fly thither. For they are not of the temper of <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who being born in a depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated Country, are brought up in Idleneſs and Sluggiſhneſs, eſpecially the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> where by too great an Indulgence of the former Reigns, the Idolatrous Prieſts have beſotted them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them that 'tis better to live in Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and do nothing, than to work; to live upon Milk and Potatos, to Lodge in Cottages
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60783:122"/> and Hutts, which any man may make in three or 4 days time, and to rob and pilfer, than to labour, and live more honeſtly, with Credit and Reputation. Such of the <hi>French</hi> as were born in Cities and Towns, or thoſe who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ſuch Places, will rather periſh in other Countries, than live ſo miſerably at home; ſo that <hi>France</hi> will in a little time be as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated as thoſe Countries, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of its People become as degenerate.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Ports of <hi>Breſt, Rochfort, Port Louis, Toulon,</hi> with all the <hi>Admiralties</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> will decay and be brought to nothing, becauſe <hi>France</hi> will not be able for the future to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great numbers of Men of war, as well thro' her want of Ability, as becauſe there is reaſon to think that Liberty will not be allowed her.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>France</hi> will not be any more able to bribe the Miniſters of Foreign Princes, their Counſellors, nor the Officers of their Armies, nor to maintain great Correſpondencies, or many Spies in their Courts.</p>
               <p n="14">14. By ſuch a ſudden Depopulation of the Kingdom, the Diſorder will be much greater and more univerſal, than if it had been done by degrees, as that of <hi>Spain;</hi> all the Subjects will be in an Extream Confuſion and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity; all things will be in diſorder there.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The Countries remote from Sea-Ports, and big Towns, will become Wilderneſſes in leſs than 20 years, like <hi>Ireland.</hi> The leſs fruitful Lands will be yet more apt to be abandoned
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60783:122"/> than the reſt, unleſs they be ſituated near ſuch Places. The wealthy Church-men, and many of the Civil Officers that are rich, and others, who may have ſome Money left, will draw in to themſelves the poor Husbandmen and Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, in order to have their own Eſtates near thoſe great Towns, inhabited and tilled, and will uſe them better than others ſhall be able to do, becauſe they are opulent, and the poor Wretches will run over to them by reaſon of that, and becauſe of the great Trade and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Money in thoſe Places.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In that great Scarcity of Men fit to Cultivate the Ground, great many People who by their Eſtate. Dignity or Profeſſion, had been formerly exempted from working, becauſe they could live without it, will turn Husbandmen, Vineyard-keepers, and Gardners, rather than be ſtarved, and have their Ground untilled and unmanured; this will be a good Effect of a bad Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Few Inns will be kept on the High-ways for want of Travellers, and Trade; as alſo by reaſon of the multitude of Thieves; which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing will contribute much towards the Ruining of ſeveral little Towns and Boroughs, to which the Paſſage of Travellers thro' their Road, was profitable.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The Poſts Offices, Carriages of Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by Land and Water, Horſes, Hackney-Coaches, and Chairs, will be diminiſhed by three parts at leaſt over all the Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:60783:123"/>
               <p n="19">19. High-ways will become unpaſſable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not mended, and Bridges over Rivers and Brooks will be all broken down.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The Banks of Rivers, which render them Navigable, will be all overthrown for want of People, and of means to keep them in repair; and alſo becauſe, that altho' they were mended, they would be uſeleſs for want of Trade; and the like will befal the Water-Mills upon the ſame Rivers, moſt of which are already fallen to nothing.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For the ſame reaſon the Bank of the great River <hi>de Loire,</hi> which is called <hi>la Leuee,</hi> and of other great Rivers that are in the ſame caſe, cannot be maintained; The <hi>Channel of the two Seas,</hi> as they call it, will be filled up, for even at preſent it would go to Ruine, were it not for the Vanity of the preſent French King who made it. I am confident alſo, that after his death, <hi>Verſailles,</hi> with all its Gardens and Water-works, will be forſaken, and with good reaſon too, to be the Retreat of Owls, Crows and Batts, becauſe of the vaſt Expence it requires to keep and maintain it in order, and by reaſon of the bad Air of the Place; for nothing but the King's Vanity, which induced him to undertake thoſe two Pieces of work, maintains them at preſent.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>France</hi> will infallibly loſe her <hi>Plantations</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> before 20 years come about, becauſe they are fit for the Engliſh and Dutch, againſt whom the French will not be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60783:123"/> able to keep them; and it ſeems indeed more convenient for the French to confine themſelves to their Antient Limits, and to apply themſelves only to Manufactures, and Husbandry, and to the repeopling of their Country, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Of all the French Cities and Towns, <hi>Paris</hi> will be the beſt able to withſtand all thoſe Calamities, provided the King's Court, the Superiour Courts of Judicature, and all the Tribunals and Juriſdictions that are in it, together with the Univerſity, be maintained there. But the King muſt needs diminiſh the number of Officers in the ſaid Tribunals and Juriſdictions very much, and in general all ſorts of Officers whatſoever, or elſe it will be impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Countries which reſort to <hi>Paris,</hi> and depend upon the ſaid Tribunals, Offices and Juriſdictions, would not be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them now that they are ruined and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated to ſuch a degree. The Number alſo of great Lords, and other wealthy Perſons, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, as well as their Wealth, and ſo will the Number of all Civil and Military Officers of the Kingdom, and even that of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and of the <hi>General Hoſpitals;</hi> ſo that unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <hi>Paris</hi> will loſe much of its former Glory and Splendor, unleſs the King deſtroys ſeveral of their Parliaments, and Inferiour Tribunals and Juriſdictions, as alſo ſome of the neareſt Univerſities, and re-unites them to thoſe of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60783:124"/> 
                  <hi>Paris,</hi> in which caſe a great number of the moſt Opulent People who are in thoſe places and ſtations, would come to live at <hi>Paris.</hi> Yet 'tis alſo true, that it would totally ſink and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Provinces and Towns where ſuch Companies do now reſide. But the French King did always regard <hi>Paris</hi> more than all the reſt of the Kingdom, which indeed it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he minded very little; ſo that that City were thriving, or at leaſt in ſplendor: If he ſhould take Poſſeſſion of the Revenues of the Regular Clergy, who are unprofitable to the Nation and the Church, and give Penſions to many thouſand Officers or Knights who ſhould Reſide at <hi>Paris,</hi> it would do a great deal of good to that City; elſe it will loſe very much becauſe of the Reaſons already alledged, and by the diminution of the number of their Forces, which cannot be leſs than that of three parts; for it furniſhed a great part of them with Cloaths, Hatts, Shoes, Woollen and Linnen; the moſt part of Officers came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every year, to paſs part of the Winter, which was of great advantage to that City, becauſe of the Money they ſpent there.</p>
               <p n="24">24. It would not be perhaps a very hard matter to tell which of the other Cities and Towns of the Kingdom, will ſubſiſt beſt after <hi>Paris;</hi> ſome of them which are already conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, will increaſe, as I ſaid, of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Marſeille,</hi> rather than decay; and perhaps ſome others, as <hi>Metz, &amp;c.</hi> for the Reaſons I
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60783:124"/> hinted at before. The moſt part of the other beſt Towns, will, I am apt to think, decay by the half of what they were 30 years ago, tho' they may ſubſiſt better than ſome others. <hi>Lions,</hi> for example, will do the better, becauſe of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to <hi>Switzerland, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp;c. and that it ſtands between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Marſeille,</hi> and upon a great River; <hi>Roüen</hi> may alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it ſelf by reaſon of its Port, River, and proximity to <hi>Paris,</hi> and becauſe it is the Head City of the beſt Province in <hi>France,</hi> provided the King does not take away its Parliament, and other Tribunals and Offices, to Re-unite them to thoſe of <hi>Paris.</hi> Theſe Towns that are near the Sea, with Harbours belonging to them, will alſo maintain themſelves a little, as <hi>Calais, Diep, Havre de Grace,</hi> St. <hi>Malo,</hi> and <hi>Nants:</hi> This laſt will ſubſiſt better than any of thoſe I juſt now named, by reaſon of the River <hi>Loire;</hi> whereas 'tis like, no other Town by that River will ſubſiſt without decaying 3 parts at leaſt, <hi>Tours</hi> and <hi>Orleans</hi> not excepted. <hi>Rochel</hi> will alſo fall very much as to its Wealth and Trade, but not ſo much as the other Towns in the Main Land; its Garriſon will uphold it a little alſo, tho' on the other ſide, Garriſons do not agree well with Trading Towns. I ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Marſeille</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. <hi>Bayon,</hi> I believe, will decay, but not ſo much as <hi>Rochel,</hi> by reaſon of its Port, and the Neighbourhood of <hi>Spain. Toulon</hi> will quite fall. All other head Cities in the Provinces will
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60783:125"/> probably decay of three fourths, except thoſe already mentioned, unleſs they become Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, thro' ſome advantage gained by Enemies, or thro' any diſmembring of the Monarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>Poictiers, Xaintes, Angouleſme, Limoges, Perigueux, Cahors, Auch, Thoulouze</hi> (unleſs <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock</hi> revolt) <hi>Pau,</hi> (unleſs the Parliament does alſo revolt) <hi>Aix, Grenoble, Dijon</hi> (unleſs the County of <hi>Bungundy</hi> be reſtored to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi>) in which caſe the Dutchy would be ſpared, <hi>Bourg</hi> in <hi>Breſſe, Forez,</hi> the large Towns of <hi>Champaigne, Chalons, Rheims, Troye,</hi> will all come to nothing; as alſo <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, Vendome, Bellème, le Mans;</hi> and even <hi>Angers,</hi> I think, notwithſtanding its ſo advantagious Situation over three Navigable Rivers, and near a fourth yet more conſiderable, <hi>viz. Loire,</hi> will, I believe, decay one half, but not ſo much as thoſe mentioned before; <hi>Rennes</hi> will bear up, if that great Province of <hi>Brittany,</hi> whereof is it the Head, doth but ſhew its teeth, and if its Parliament be maintained; <hi>Nevers, Moulins, Clermont, Rion, Bourges, Gueret, Rhodez,</hi> will be reduc'd almoſt to nothing and all the reſt of the Towns in the Kingdom, except perhaps ſome little ones, which I have forgot on the Coaſts of the Ocean, and that are inconſiderable: <hi>Caen</hi> may uphold it ſelf a little, by reaſon of its ſmall River and Proximity to the Sea, as alſo becauſe of its fruitful Soil, but it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay by above the half. <hi>Montpellier</hi> and <hi>Niſmes</hi> may alſo bear up; and I believe that great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60783:125"/> of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſo mighty powerful, being ſo near <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo remote from <hi>Paris,</hi> and a Province having States, and not far from the Sea, tho' without Harbours, will one day make it ſelf free.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Almoſt all the Univerſities will fall to nothing.</p>
               <p n="26">26. A Civil War in <hi>France</hi> ſeems to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, and may perhaps begin ſpeedily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Peace; for what can they do with ſo many diſcontented People, who will be all ruined, and brought into deſpair? what can they do with ſo many Troops that muſt be disbanded, and ſtarve, and who are uſed to procure themſelves neceſſaries by violent ways?</p>
               <p n="27">27. In caſe there be no Civil War, which it is like there will, part of the Province of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> which holds up as yet a little, part of the Country adjacent to <hi>Metz,</hi> called <hi>Pais Meſſin,</hi> as alſo part of the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and of <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> will not decay ſo much as ſome other parts of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe of their being Frontiers to <hi>Spain,</hi> or to the Spaniſh Netherlands, to <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and to the <hi>County of Burgundy,</hi> which three laſt are like to be reſtored to their natural Land-Lords. Part of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> alſo will not decay ſo much as others, by reaſon of its proximity to the Sea, and to <hi>Roüen</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> but that part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince which is plentiful in Paſtures by which it makes at preſent great profits, becauſe the Importing of the Iriſh Salt-beef, Butter and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60783:126"/> Cheeſe is obſtructed; that part, I ſay, will loſe much in thoſe things by the Peace, becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> can afford them cheaper, as formerly it did</p>
               <p n="28">28. There will be little Exportation of Commodities from <hi>France,</hi> and the ſmall Trade which ſhe had from one Maritime-Province to another, will all fall into the hand of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The Pope, the Monks, and eſpecially the Jeſuites, will domineer over <hi>France</hi> more than ever, which will be both an effect of the weakneſs of the Royal Authority, and at the ſame time will occaſion a Great and Univerſal Contempt of the ſaid Authority.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The Prieſts for the future will hardly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to read, by reaſon that if heretofore none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt did bring up their Children to be Prieſts, but Peaſants and Artiſts, when they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherewithal to live, they cannot do it now, for want of Means; 'tis probable that in Cities and great Towns, and there only, ſome that have yet ſomething whereon to live, may bring up ſome of their Children to School, to endeavour to get the beſt Church-livings for them, if ſo be the King does not appropriate them to better Uſes. We muſt expect that the Clergy, how abominable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be at preſent in general, ſome few excepted, will be much more diſorderly and ſcandalous for the future; not only for the Reaſons above-mentioned, but becauſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60783:126"/> are baniſhed out of that Country. Many more Miracles will be done in it, the Church-man's Impoſture increaſing by degrees proportionably to the People's Ignorance and Licentiouſneſs, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Spain, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31. <hi>France</hi> will undoubtedly loſe <hi>Dunkirk</hi> by the Peace, if King <hi>William</hi> deſires it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</p>
               <p n="32">32. After the Peace, there will be as many Beggars as now, becauſe of the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Families which cannot be recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from their total ruine, eſpecially thoſe who are deſtitute of Men, the others being not able to help them. Beſides this, all things will be turn'd up ſide down, and many more Lands abandoned, by the product of which many Widows and Orphans did live.</p>
               <p n="33">33. The State of the People cannot be fixed in twenty years after the Peace; I mean, that the People will not be certain whether Debtors ſhall be obliged to pay their Debts contracted before the Peace, nor how they ſhall pay them, and at what rates, and on what footing Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors will take their Lands or Houſes in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whether many Tribunals of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Offices will be aboliſhed; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King will not rather turn out the 2 third parts, or the 3 fourths of all the Officers, and ſo forth, in the <hi>Generalities, Courts of Aides, Chambers of Accounts, Courts of the Mint, Elections, Salt Stores,</hi> &amp;c. How many of them will be
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60783:127"/> turned out, and which, who ſhall loſe their Places, or whether the King will reimburſe them or not, and how far; If the Debtors, or Civil Officers, or other Perſons with whom they have to deal, are to loſe all, or whether their Debts being paid, they ſhall yet have ſome remainder, and how much, for there will be 9 parts of 10 who won't have a Farthing left; whether the French Proteſtants ſhall be re-eſtabliſhed or not; whether the King will always keep on foot ſuch a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Officers and Souldiers by Land and Sea, as he did before this War; how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands he ſhall Caſhier, and which Regiments or Officers; whether he will play the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or no, to all thoſe who lent him Money, and how far he will pay or indemnifie them, and ſo forth; Then as to all old and new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which he may annul, how far he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe thoſe who bought them; whether he ſhall be able to do it, and how; whether he will not diminiſh the Expences of his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and the number of Officers belonging to the ſame; whether he has a mind to govern always deſpotically, or to take advice of the States of the Kingdom as formerly, without whoſe conſent he ſhall not be able to impoſe any Taxes on the People; whether a Civil War is to be feared in the Kingdom or no; whether the <hi>King</hi> ſhall not make uſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice to his Subjects, by ſaving ſo much Expence, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60783:127"/> preventing delays of Juſtice which are ſo ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, and which will be ſo much the more troubleſom and oppreſſive after the Peace, that inſtead of the quietneſs and eaſe which they expect and ſtand ſo much in need of, they will be expoſed to the ravenings of hungry Lawyers, who will prolong and protract the proceedings of innumerable Suits that will ariſe from ſo many alterations and changes that have happened in Families by the War; for I dare venture to ſay, that no Family in the Kingdom will be free from ſuch troubles; Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt know alſo, whether the King will not change the method of raiſing the Impoſts, whether by Farmers and their Commiſſioners, and other ſuch Tools, who lie ſo heavy upon the Nation, or by a more reaſonable way; and whether the Intereſt of Money will be at 8, or 10, or 15 <hi>per cent;</hi> Whether Lands will be ſold at 3, or 6, or 8, or 10 years purchaſe, or on ſome other foot, and ſeveral other ſuch things; Whether the half or the two-thirds of Lands in the Kingdom will be abandoned, and what will become of all thoſe forſaken Eſtates; which Provinces or Countries will be the moſt depopulated. Till People are informed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly of all thoſe things and others, and till the State of the Nation is fixed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, Lands, Houſes and Offices cannot be diſpoſed of, nor bought nor ſold, but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo ſoon regulated. The King muſt fix another rate for Offices, very much below that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60783:128"/> which they were valued at before, if ſo be he intends to keep up the ſale of them, or elſe the number of them muſt needs fall prodigiouſly.</p>
               <p n="34">34. There will happen an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Suits at Law between Families, by reaſon of Succeſſions, Portions, Debts; and thoſe who have Money, and keep it, will be more prudent than if they beſtowed it upon corrupt Judges, to buy from them other Mens Eſtates, which will not be worth ſo much as the Money given to the Lawyers, for after the Peace no Eſtate in <hi>France</hi> will be comparable to Money.</p>
               <p n="35">35. The French Tongue, the Modes and Faſhions, and the good Breeding of <hi>France,</hi> will not be ſo much eſteemed in Foreign Courts, and none will have ſo great reſpect hereafter for their Kings as formerly. The time is come wherein it will be thought, that all thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers of the French Tongue have imployed their time very ill about it, and all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finings will be very much neglected, and they ſhall not be able to preſerve it from degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, no more than the good Breeding and Delicacy of that Nation; all theſe things will come to nothing by the Extream Poverty and Ignorance into which the People of <hi>France</hi> will fall irrecoverably.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> who may have hereafter a propenſion to make uſe of Traitors, will find Men enough of that ſtamp in the Kingdom, the King's Authority being ſo much decayed, as well as his Power; and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60783:128"/> taking hold of the Nation, Perfidiouſneſs, Treachery, and Violence will increaſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably among the Subjects, and it will be more eaſie than ever to bribe Judges, and all kinds of People.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Intereſt of Money will riſe notably in <hi>France</hi> after the Peace, which will make an end of all the reſt of the Manufactures and Trade in that Kingdom, if there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, or at leaſt it will hinder them from being ever re-eſtabliſhed. As for the reſtoring of Manufactures, I ſhall not ſay, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reſtore them to their former State, but even to any conſiderable degree, becauſe they have been ſet up, and are well improved in Foreign Countries by the Refugees.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The number of Curats, and other Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts, muſt needs decreaſe, by reaſon that Pariſhes will not be able to maintain ſuch great numbers of them, above the half of the Men being periſhed. Their caſe thro' all the Kingdom, will be probably the ſame with that of Curates in ſome parts of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and in the Land of <hi>Artois,</hi> where the Pariſhes are but ſmall; there a Curate ſays Maſs every day in two Pariſhes, that are not in a capacity to maintain each a Curate: 'Tis eaſily conceived, that their Private Comings in, are now worth much leſs to them, than formerly; and the Time will grow worſe and worſe for them, whether it be Peace or not, ſince we ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeveral Provinces almoſt deſerted, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60783:129"/> many Borroughs and Villages that have not the fourth part of Inhabitants they had before this War, Mortality and Famine having ſnatcht away moſt of the reſt. All the places ſituated on the Roads, that are obnoxious to the Rudeneſs of Soldiers, have been abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe of the Marches, Counter-marches and Quarterings of the Troops, as I ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. 'Tis eaſie to conceive thoſe places are much depopulated, and that a Curate can't fare well there; it may be two or three Pariſhes will be turned to one; I confeſs it will be a great trouble to People, to go ſo far to Church. But what other Remedy is there, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain one in every Pariſh, as they did hitherto? As for Pariſhes, that have ſeveral Prieſts, they muſt needs turn them all out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one, for few of them will be able to keep more.</p>
               <p n="39">39. The Military Art and Diſcipline will viſibly degenerate in <hi>France,</hi> and Men grow leſs couragious and even cowardly, as Men uſually do in depopulated, poor, and ſlaviſh Countries, unleſs the King applies, as I have ſaid already, the Revenues of the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> for the conſtant maintenance of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of brave Officers for his Emergencies, not to make Conqueſts any more, God forbid, but only for the Defence of his Kingdom, and of his Allies.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Painting, Sculpture, Engraving, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, and many other Trades leſs neceſſary,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60783:129"/> and which ſerve only for Curioſity, Ornament, or Luxury, will fall entirely. The uſeful ones are already very much decayed, but they will decay yet more.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The ſcarcity of People will occaſion all Servants to be dear every where in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo that I believe they will be conſtrained to give leave to buy <hi>Negroes,</hi> as is practiſed in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and as all Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do in <hi>America;</hi> and that the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting to keep Slaves in <hi>France</hi> will be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We may obſerve by the way, what a great Change hath happened in the French Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince the Eſtabliſhment of that Law, for then they were good natur'd to all Mankind, nay even to Heathens, and the moſt barbarous and remote People; whereas at this day they deal with the Natives, their Fellow-Citizens, and Chriſtians, worſe than others do with Slaves any where, nay even worſe than with brute Beaſts, whoſe Owners take care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them well for the ſervice they do, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Rulers in <hi>France,</hi> do not allow the People who work more than Slaves or Beaſts, to fill their Bellies with Bread, and ſacrifice them beſides every day by thouſands to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Ambition and Vanity.</p>
               <p n="42">42. There will be no more Sumptuouſneſs in Buildings, Furniture of Houſes, Tables, nor Equipages in <hi>France,</hi> tho' Luxury indeed will always be extravagant, yet it muſt be leſs than it was formerly, becauſe of their great Poverty.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:60783:130"/>
               <p n="43">43. Univerſities, Academies, Colledges and Chools will decraſe ſtrangely in number; So that I do not believe <hi>France</hi> will ſtand in need for the future of more Univerſities than there are in <hi>Spain, viz.</hi> three, inſtead of almoſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that are there at preſent, beſides the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Colledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Profits of Doctors or Maſters, are already fallen more than 9 parts in 10, for want of Students and Money.</p>
               <p n="44">44. The number of Comedians, Rope-dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Muſicians, Fidlers, Dancing-maſters, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-maſters and ſuch like, will decreaſe yearly more and more, tho' there be not at preſent the 10th part of what there was 30 years ago.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Parents able to beſtow Money upon their Children, will deſire them to ſettle in Sea-ports, or in the beſt and leaſt ruined Cities, which we named before.</p>
               <p n="46">46. In that general Deſolation, few Refugees will think of returning to <hi>France,</hi> except thoſe who are here in Extream Want, and who did poſſeſs Lands and Houſes in <hi>France,</hi> in caſe the free Exerciſe of their Religion be reſtored. On the contrary, 'tis like that many new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts will leave <hi>France,</hi> what precaution ſoever be taken to hinder their eſcape, if ſo be, as I ſaid before, they are not reſtored to their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liberty of Conſcience. But I queſtion very much, whether they ſhall be re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, during <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. Reign, unleſs it be by the potent interpoſition of King
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60783:130"/> 
                  <hi>William,</hi> and of the other Proteſtant Allies, tho' it be the Kingdoms Intereſt to do it ſpeedily; for it ſeems that, notwithſtanding the lamentable condition to which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that flouriſhing Kingdom, he comforts himſelf with the thoughts of the miſchief he hath done to the Proteſtant Party in it, and even glories in having, as he thinks, quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Reformed Religion there, and I incline to think that he will look upon what he has done as the only Reſſource of Glory left him; and I do not doubt in the leaſt but that his Counſel of Conſcience, <hi>Father la Chaiſe</hi> and <hi>Madame Maintonon</hi> do bleſs themſelves in it, and fortifie the <hi>King</hi> in ſuch imaginations; and that the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> will keep him by their ſecret, but powerful influences in that frame of mind, giving him hopes perhaps of a degree of Glory above St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and next to St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> in their Heaven: But I am confident, that they will contrive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out ſome <hi>Medium</hi> to catch the Refugies in their Net, I mean both as to Soul and Body, for as 'tis againſt the Clergy's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or rather Paſſion, and even againſt the falſe Glory of that King, that the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſhould be reſtored to the Condition they were in before the Violation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, and that their Religion ſhould be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized; ſo 'tis alſo againſt the Kingdoms Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that it ſhould loſe for ever ſo many uſeful Subjects; So that I make no doubt, but they
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60783:131"/> will make uſe of all Tricks and Subtilties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable to draw them in by a kind of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which would do their buſineſs if the Refugees were Fools; for by that means a great many would come to them with what Eſtates they have carried away, and the new Converts would have no mind to leave the Kingdom, and yet their Religion ſhould be deſtroyed for ever; and they will alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the uſual method of <hi>Rome,</hi> bribe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and wordly Preachers amongſt them, to divide them in their Opinions, as 'tis like they actually do, in order to bring them to Popery again, by the Back-door, according to the Maxim, <hi>Divide &amp; Impera</hi> And I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo that in order to hinder the reſtoration of true <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in that Kingdom, the Jeſuits will put the French King upon the Deſign of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying <hi>Geneva</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Switzers</hi> and make him believe that it will be a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Deſtruction of his Kingdom, and that it is the moſt glorious thing he can do; and for that reaſon they will, it may be, ſpare the <hi>Vaudois</hi> for ſome time, to diſguiſe their Deſign.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Several Lackeys, Servants and ſuch ſort of Men, having got ſome Imploys and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in this War, will be apt to inſult and deſpiſe their Ancient Lords and Maſters, who are reduced to Poverty and totally ruined, and a great deal of inſolence will be ſeen every where.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:60783:131"/>
               <p n="48">48. Several Widows of Quality and Young Ladys, whoſe number is three times greater than that of Men of their own rank, will Marry below their Degree, nay, even Servant-men, rather than be Unmarried.</p>
               <p n="49">49. The <hi>Gabelle,</hi> or Exciſe upon Salt muſt needs fall; ſuch an Enormous Tax cannot ſubſiſt any longer in the moſt part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and great Towns of the Kingdom, or elſe the price of Salt muſt be reduced to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable rate, as a Penny a Pound, and not to 10, or 12, or 15 pence <hi>per cent.</hi> as the King ſells it at preſent. The Kingdom will never endure the <hi>Gabeleurs,</hi> that is, the Exactors of that Impoſition, any more, when the <hi>K.</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep great Forces on foot, and that thoſe he maintains muſt be kept on the Frontiers; So that I am of opinion, that the People will not any longer be ſo patient, and beſides they will not be in condition to pay ſo many Taxes, for of a long time they have been compelled to pay thoſe exceſſive Taxes by the terrour of the Forces, who would not have failed in a little time to have overſlowed the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> that ſhould have refuſed to pay 'em; for, as I ſaid elſewhere, we may truly ſay that the French Government, is altogether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, and that the Subjects are treated worſe even in time of Peace, than other Countrys uſe to be, when invaded by Armies of Enemies, even at the time when they are about ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:60783:132"/>
               <p n="50">50. Such as did earneſtly covet a long time to joyn his Neighbours Land or Field to his own, and could not attain it, find now adays very often an occaſion to do it, and to purchaſe for a little Sum of Money, that for which they would have formerly paid ten times more, but they are in danger to repent after the Peace, when they ſhall ſee too late, that by the utter Deſolation of the Kingdom, the thing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed is not worth the Money; And they are even in danger before the <hi>Peace</hi> is made, to pay to the <hi>King</hi> for that very purchaſe, ſuch Taxes as will amount to 3 or 4 times as much as they gave to the Seller.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Such as have many Lands, and ſee that they are not ſo much depopulated as others, and who flatter 'emſelves with hopes that their Farmers and Peaſants will ſtay in their Farms, becauſe they are fixed there at preſent, will be very much deceived, when after the Peace they ſhall ſee that thoſe Farmers and Clowns will leave him, and remove, it may be, ten or twelve Leagues farther with their Families, where they will find Lands for nothing, or much cheaper than theirs was; and every one will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to draw in the Farmers and Servants one of another, and rather than ſee their Land untilled and forſaken, will give it out <hi>gratis</hi> for a certain number of years; and ſupply the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants with all neceſſaries to Manure it; and I am confident, that even at this preſent, the prudenteſt ſort, who have Lands of their own,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60783:132"/> do practiſe it in ſeveral places. Some Provinces and Countries are leſs depopulated than others, (through Mortality and Famine) have been; but I am ſure that thoſe who have great Eſtates in Land in the Countries moſt depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated, as in the adjacent parts to <hi>Paris,</hi> will uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to draw in the Peaſants of other places; and this will do more miſchief to the Kingdom, than if every one did ſtay in the moſt depopulated Country, as I have demonſtrated it elſewhere. 'Tis true, that as for the adjacent parts of <hi>Paris,</hi> there is, it ſeems, an indiſpenſible Neceſſity to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people them again, becauſe of the City, but unleſs there be a great Moderation of the Taxes on thoſe parts, 'tis impoſſible that Country ſhould be ever Re-peopled again; for it muſt be known, that there is hardly any part of the Kingdom ſo oppreſſed with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as that is. Formerly one could ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about <hi>Paris</hi> but Towns, large and rich Boroughs, well-built and peopled; but even before the beginning of this War, they were much ruined, and 'tis certain that all is deſart there at preſent.</p>
               <p n="52">52. I do not think that <hi>Paris</hi> in a hundred years hence, can be ſo well peopled, as it was thirty years ago. The Revenues of the King and of the great Perſons at <hi>Paris,</hi> and even in all the Kingdom in general, being ſunk as they are, not half the Commodities will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed there, as was formerly.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:60783:133"/>
               <p n="53">53. If the Ancient Government of <hi>France, viz.</hi> by the general Eſtates of the Kingdom, were re-eſtabliſhed again, as Paſſion, Ambition, vain Glory and Superſtition, would domineer leſs, and Reaſon and the true Intereſt of the Nation would be more hearkned to, in that caſe the Reformed Religion would be reſtored: But <hi>Rome</hi> will oppoſe it with all her Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and 'tis like the Inquiſition will be ſet up in <hi>France,</hi> as 'tis in <hi>Spain, Portugual,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> againſt the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p n="54">54. The number of Uſurers will be much greater in <hi>France</hi> after the Peace than ever; this will be the moſt ordinary way to improve Money to the beſt advantage, the Manufactures and Trade being ruined, and the Real Eſtates being brought to nothing, as well as the Offices.</p>
               <p n="55">55. As ſoon as the Peace is made, the King will ſqueeze all the Farmers general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of Impoſitions, which he is obliged to indulge now, becauſe they advance him Money, and by that means he ſhall get yet vaſt Sums.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Thoſe who have yet ſome remainder of their former Eſtates, I mean, thoſe who having paid their Debts, ſhall have yet ſome Lands Manur'd in the Country, or ſome Houſes inhabited in the Citys, may live as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I think, after <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. <hi>Death,</hi> with their ſmall Eſtates as they did 20 years ago, by reaſon that tho' they ſhall not injoy perhaps the 4th part of the Revenue they had before, Taxes will be diminiſhed 3 parts at leaſt, and the King
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60783:133"/> or his Succeſſor will not, 'tis probable, form any Projects of Conqueſts ſo ſoon. But I confeſs, a Civil War, as I ſaid already, is mightily to be feared, becauſe there will not be found one Man amongſt twenty, but what will be utterly ruined. I grant, that thoſe Perſons, who have ſome remainder of their former Eſtates, will not be able to take a Journey now and then to <hi>Paris</hi> to divert themſelves, as was uſual, becauſe Proviſions will ſtill continue to be dear there, nor will they be capable to ſend their Children a-far off, in ortler to Study or Travel, becauſe Money will continue long to be ſcarce, and their Revenues too ſmall, to be ſpent abroad. Their caſe will be much like that of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> who poſſeſs ſome Eſtates at a great diſtance from <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="56">56. The number of the King's Officers, and of the Princes and Princeſſes Houſhold, muſt needs decreaſe very much, as alſo their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries. The number of Governments and Governours of Cities, Towns, Caſtles, Forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will decreaſe alſo, as well as their Sallaries. The number of the Forces and of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers by Land and Sea, and of the Gallies will decreaſe, as alſo their Wages. And the like will happen to all Civil Officers, as I have ſaid already; and all things will be in an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confuſion in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The moſt clear-ſighted Men in <hi>France,</hi> do not conceive the Degree of the Kingdoms Ruine. All thoſe who have yet ſome Eſtate left, fancy
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60783:134"/> themſelves to be richer than really they are, tho' they acknowledge and ſay they are ruined.</p>
               <p>This miſtake has been mighty favourable to the Kings Affairs a long time, by reaſon that many Mony'd Men judging of the Affairs of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than they are, did ſcruple leſs to lend him Money, or to buy ſome of the new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and even Lands or Houſes, and ſo did lay out their Money, which came at laſt into the Kings Hands.</p>
               <p>The beſt remedy that I know, to repair the prodigious Loſſes of the People of <hi>France,</hi> and to reſtore the Kingdom to its former Populouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I confeſs cannot be done perfectly in 2 hundred years time, would be to make Peace as ſoon as poſſible, whatever it may coſt, and then to change the Form of the preſent Government, and to re-eſtabliſh the Ancient Government of a <hi>King</hi> with the Counſel of the general Eſtates of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſuch as is now in <hi>England;</hi> and moreover, to renounce all Conqueſts; to allow all Liberty and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to French and Foreign Proteſtants; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the Buying and Selling all ſorts of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; not to let out the Impoſitions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Farmers, and to put out of their Places all thoſe who are dipt in ſuch Tyrannical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; and to ſet all Monks and Nuns at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to give leave to Subjects to buy Slaves, and to Marry them together, in order to get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by them, and that they ſhould continue
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60783:134"/> to be Slaves, both they and their Children, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their Maſters conſent to their being made free, conſidering that their condition would ſtill be a great deal better than would have been in their Native Country, and that 'tis much leſs againſt Reaſon and Religion to uſe them ſo, than 'tis to Tyrannize, as is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt moſt of the Chriſtian Nations in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, over Chriſtians that are born ſuch, and free-born alſo, and to keep them in bondage, as is done particularly in <hi>France,</hi> where their condition is worſe for the moſt part, than that of the Galley-ſlaves, nay, even of Beaſts, as I have ſaid already.</p>
               <p>It would alſo be convenient to buy a certain number of Men yearly from the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes (ſince they make a Trade of them) not to make Slaves of 'em, but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſtribute Lands to them, which they ſhould Cultivate, and to treat them as the reſt of Subjects, with moderation, equity, and kindneſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP VII. A Liſt of the principal Impoſitions and Taxes in the Kingdom of <hi>FRANCE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Do not believe that there is any Man in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> that can give an account of all the Impoſitions and Taxes under which that People groans, ſo numerous are they. But I have here thought fit to preſent you with a Catalogue of all that I can recollect. Every Province has ſome ſpecial Tax which is unknown to any other, and ſometimes they have ſtrange Denominations, as from thoſe that firſt invented them, or were the Farmers of them, or from the place where they began to be eſtabliſhed, or from the odd Language of ſome Provinces, which is not underſtood by the People of any other, or from ſome other reaſon; if any Man would, or rather could tell the manner in which every one of them is raiſed, and what Revenue it brings in to the King, and the firſt Origin of them, it would require a very large Book.</p>
               <p>There is a great many of 'em always ſtanding as well in Peace as in War upon all Real Eſtates, Houſes and Lands, and very ſevere too; as alſo upon Perſonal Eſtates, and upon Money lent
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60783:135"/> or hoarded up; upon the Induſtry of Men and Women; Upon all Offices either of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Finances, or Civil Government, and other Offices which are innumerable; upon every thing that is eat or drunk, or ſerves for cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; upon all ſorts and conditions of Men and Women generally, and even upon Publick Beggars; upon every thing imported or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, either in or out of the Kingdom, or from one Province or City in the Kingdom to another; and there are ſeveral new ones inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every day, which croſs and deſtroy one another, for what is got by the one is loſt by the other, the Kingdom being ſo horridly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</p>
               <p>I don't undertake to ennumerate them all, as I ſaid above, but only thoſe which are come to my knowledge, with ſome of their Names in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and ſome in <hi>French,</hi> becauſe they cannot well be tranſlated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L'Ayde,</hi> the Aid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L'Octroy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Preciput.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L'Equivalent,</hi> the Equivalent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taxe,</hi> 'tis a ſpecial Tax ſo called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taille,</hi> a very hard Tax.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taillon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subvention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Etape,</hi> Staple for the Soldiers.</p>
               <p>For the Utenſil of Soldiers.</p>
               <p>For the Subſiſtence.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:60783:136"/>
               <p>For the Garriſons.</p>
               <p>For the Morte-pays.</p>
               <p>For the Wages of Governours.</p>
               <p>For the Kings Debts and Affairs.</p>
               <p>For Extraordinary Gratifications.</p>
               <p>For the Free-gift.</p>
               <p>Expences of Recovery and Accomptability.</p>
               <p>The Taxes upon Land-Eſtates and Houſes do oftentimes exceed what the Proprietor gets from them, at leaſt one half, and many are willing to yield them up for the Tax, who are not admitted to do it.</p>
               <p>There are Taxes upon Drink, <hi>as follows,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aids or Subſidies upon Wines.</p>
               <p>Upon Cyder.</p>
               <p>Brandy.</p>
               <p>Beer.</p>
               <p>Vinegar.</p>
               <p>Verjuice.</p>
               <p>Chocolate, Tea, Sorbek, Coffee, and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon all other Liquid Things, or that wherewith any Drink can be made.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be noted, that the Exciſe upon Win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> goes ſo metimes in Cities far above the price of the Commodity, and ſeeing that ſince the War, the poor Working-people in Cities, who were uſed formerly to drink ſome Wine, could not buy it, for want of Money, but drank a little Brandy inſtead of it, they have doubled the Exciſe upon Brandy.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:60783:136"/>
               <p>And then there's another upon Liquors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Jaujage,</hi> the Duty for gaging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Courtage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Souquect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Patac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Impoſts and Billots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve,</hi> there is ſuch a horrid Severity and Tyranny uſed in the Cities and all other Towns, Borroughs and Villages as to the Wine, that if ſo be a Friend did ſend any Bottles of his Wine to another Friend who has none ſo good, or to any Sick Perſon, he is preſently accuſed of defrauding the Kings Exciſe, and is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be Impriſoned and loſe all his Eſtate, or a great part of it, for it muſt be underſtood that, beſides what all the Wine pays generally at the Gates of every conſiderable Town, for the Duty which is very high, the Vintners in all Towns, Borroughs and Villages pay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other great Duties upon every Veſſel of Wine they ſell, and that their Cellars are every day viſited, ſearched and gaged by many hundreds of Raſcals appointed for that purpoſe, who have great Wages allowed them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many Gentlemen and Burghers have ſome Wine from their own Vineyards, for which they pay at the Gates of every great Town, the Farmers of the Impoſitions, who have an unlimited Authority, will not ſuffer them to ſend out of their Houſes not ſo much as a Bottle of their own Wine, pretending that there is ſo much the leſs conſumed in the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60783:137"/> Taverns; and that the Profits are ſo much the leſſer, and whoſoever does it, is in danger to be Impriſoned and totally ruined.</p>
               <p>Then there's an Exciſe upon all Eatables.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gabelle</hi> or Tax upon all ſorts of Corn and Meal, which is received at the Markets, Mills and other places, under the Name of <hi>Meſure d'Octroy,</hi> or <hi>Meſure coupeè;</hi> that is, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Octroy, or cut Meaſure. And there have been ſome Additions to that Duty ſince the War.</p>
               <p>The Duty upon all Cattle generally, called <hi>Le Piè fourché,</hi> this is raiſed in the Roads.</p>
               <p>Several <hi>Deniers</hi> beſides, by Pound-weight, upon all ſorts of Meat in the Shambles or Slaughter-houſe.</p>
               <p>The Impoſts, which is raiſed in all the great Towns under the Name of <hi>Entries</hi> upon all ſorts of <hi>Cattle.</hi> upon wild and tame Fowl, Butter, Cheeſe, Freſh-water Salt and dry Fiſh, Eggs, Fruits, Milk and things made of Milk, Herbs, Roots, Oranges, Lemons, Swine-breads, Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Nuts, Apples, Pares, Muſhrooms and generally upon all ſorts of things which may be eaten; as alſo upon Timber and Fire-wood, upon Charcoal, Hay, Oats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe Duties are ſo intollerably high in the great Towns, that reckoning thoſe on Liquors, Cloathing-Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Commodities imported into <hi>Paris;</hi> it was generally ſaid, that the <hi>Entries</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> alone did bring in to the King above 20 Millions of Livers, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60783:137"/>
'tis one of the beſt Branches of the French King's Revenue, tho' it muſt be diminiſhed one half at leaſt ſince the War, becauſe of the Decreaſe and Poverty of the People.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that all the Cities and great Towns are walled, and that there is at the Gates of them a kind of Watch-houſes, where the Farmers of Impoſitions, do poſt men Armed, who viſit all ſorts of Perſons, that they ſhould not import any thing into it, without paying the Cuſtoms or Exciſe, and if any is found de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding the Exciſe, the Men are ſent to the Gallyes if they are poor, and the Women whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Hang-man, and if ſo be they have any Eſtate, they loſe all or moſt part of it, and ſtand at the Farmers mercy, tho' the thing be not worth ſometimes half a Crown. Any Lord or Gentleman coming thither in a <hi>Coach</hi> or on <hi>Horſeback</hi> is obliged to ſtop at the Gate, till they have viſited his <hi>Coach, Mails, and Trunks,</hi> and ſearched his <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and that in the middle of the Kingdom; and if a Pound of Salt or any other Commodity was found upon them, all his Equipage would be forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Perſon Impriſoned, and Condemned to pay vaſt Sums of <hi>Money:</hi> Altho' the fraud ſhould not import Two Pence loſs to the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>And at ſuch Gates of Towns ſeveral things pay almoſt as much Duty as they coſt at firſt buying.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:60783:138"/>
               <p>The <hi>Gabelle</hi> or Exciſe upon Salt, which is ſo exorbitant, that Salt which is Nature's Gift, and upon the Sea-Coaſt, where it is made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without Charges, does not ſtand Foreign Merchants a Farthing <hi>per pound,</hi> is ſold to the Subjects for 10, 12 and 14 pence <hi>per pound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are above a thouſand great Offices of Salt-Exciſe, called <hi>Bureaux,</hi> or <hi>Greniers à ſel</hi> who have each of them ſeveral Officers both great and ſmall, belonging to them; and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thouſands of other Men in Towns, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs and Villages, who fetch it from ſuch Granaries, and ſell it to the People for 10 or 12 pence a pound or more. And beſides them, the Collectors of the <hi>Salt-Exciſe</hi> in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh are obliged in ſome Provinces to fetch it alſo from thoſe <hi>Salt-Granaries,</hi> to diſtribute it among the People; for tis not raiſed in the ſame method every where. In ſome Places no body is obliged to take more than he can ſpend, but in moſt other places every one is forced to take a certain quantity, tho' he does not need one half of it for his own uſe, and if ſo be he would beſtow the Overplus of it as Charity to any Beggar, and that the thing were proved, he, as well as the Beggar muſt to the Gallies, becauſe they will ſuppoſe that he ſells it; and ſeveral thouſands of poor people are ſent to the Gallies every year upon the account of the Salt.</p>
               <p>Formerly the Nobility and Gentry were free from this horrid Impoſition, that is 30 years
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60783:138"/> ago, becauſe of the Services ſuppoſed to have been done by their Anceſtors to the Crown, and becauſe they commonly ſerve in the King's Armies and muſt be always ready. But this King has taken away all their Priviledges and increaſed all their Charges</p>
               <p>Some Proprietors had ſome Springs and Pits of Salt-water, which were part of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but they have been all ſtopt by the Kings Order, and if ſo be the Proprietor open them again, he muſt go to the Gallies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gabelle</hi> is a great Branch of the King's Reuenue, but 'tis fallen at leaſt two thirds ſince the War. It did maintain, beſides what the King got in clear Money from it, about 30 thouſand Men, called <hi>Gabeleurs</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all Armed as Soldiers both Horſe and Foot, who did commit horrid Violences and Oppreſſions againſt the Nobility and People, but the number of 'em muſt alſo be much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, becauſe of the Ruine of that Kingdom, and that the King wants ſuch Men for Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are other Impoſitions alſo, as,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mark upon Paper.</p>
               <p>The Duty upon ſtampt Paper and Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Shoes.</p>
               <p>Perrwicks.</p>
               <p>And alſo upon Tobacco, beſides what is paid at the Cuſtom-Office.</p>
               <p>Upon all ſort of Stuffs, either of Silk or Wooll, made in the Kingdom, beſides thoſe that are imported.</p>
               <p>All ſorts of Linnen.</p>
               <p>Upon the Ice.</p>
               <p>And Leather.</p>
               <p>Thread.</p>
               <p>And all ſorts of Laces, either Gold or Silver, Silk, Woollen or Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon Cards.</p>
               <p>Dice.</p>
               <p>Needles.</p>
               <p>Pins.</p>
               <p>Earthen-Pots and Veſſels.</p>
               <p>Spinning wheels.</p>
               <p>Window-glaſſes.</p>
               <p>Drinking-glaſſes, Bottles and all ſorts of Glaſſ-work.</p>
               <p>Upon all Meaſures, for things Dry and Liquid, as Buſhels, Pecks, Pots, and even the Pails of the poor Criers of Water in the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> who muſt pay very dear for the Mark of the aforeſaid <hi>Pails, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are alſo other Impoſitions,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>Upon all Offices of Charrets in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60783:139"/> called <hi>Burcaux de Meſſagerie,</hi> who pay very dear for that Priviledge.</p>
               <p>Upon all Hackney-Coaches, thro' the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and upon all Horſe-litters.</p>
               <p>Upon the Water-Boats, called <hi>Coches d'Eau,</hi> which carry People by Water.</p>
               <p>Hackney Horſes.</p>
               <p>Chair-men.</p>
               <p>Porters.</p>
               <p>And thoſe who empty Houſes of Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then there are other Taxes,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>Upon the Fees, called <hi>Biens Nobles,</hi> every five years, which are very heavy.</p>
               <p>The Inquiries after the Titles of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, now and then, which have ruined many of them in this Reign, as well by the Sums given to the King on pretence of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Titles, as to the Proſecutors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other Expences, and the loſs of Time; for the Nobility were obliged to go ſometimes fifty Leagues to ſhew their Titles, tho' the ſame Titles had been formerly approved of, and if they had loſt them by fire or otherwiſe, they were caſt, or if they had bought Letters of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility about 80 or a hundred years ago, they were obliged to pay for 'em again, or if they had been in ſome function, called <hi>Ignoble,</hi> that is, below a Nobleman, they were obliged to buy their Nobility again. A hundred ſuch unworthy ways have been uſed againſt them in this Reign</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:60783:140"/>
               <p>So that the Nobility and Gentry have more reaſon to abhor this Reign than any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Then there is the Sale of Letters of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Where I would deſire the Reader to obſerve, that the Enquiry of which we ſpoke juſt now, was under pretence to purge the falſe Nobility from the true, and now by the ſale, of the Nobility, any Raſcal is made Noble for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: And this King has made abundance of ſuch Nobles for their Coin, who are at laſt turned Beggars as well as the reſt.</p>
               <p>Then there is the voluntary Rehabilitation of thoſe who pretending to have been Nobles formerly, had fallen from their Nobility, and deſired to be reſtored to it for Money; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, there is another Rehabilitation which is forced, that is, when the <hi>Maltotiers</hi> queſtion a Gentleman's Nobility, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that his Grandfather, or Father, or he himſelf has been in ſome low function, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then the Conſirmation from time to time, of the Letters of Nobility, coſts as much as at firſt.</p>
               <p>Another Trick was the <hi>Caſſation</hi> or Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſaid Nobility, for want of the Payment of the ſaid Confirmation, becauſe they were exhauſted and ruined: So that they loſe the ſame Nobility, which they paid ſo dear for, tho' their Anceſtors have enjoyed the Title for a great many years.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:60783:140"/>
               <p>And this new Tax about the Coats of Arms and the Titles which the Gentry have aſſumed to themſelves, is another new Vexation as well againſt them, as the reſt of the Nation. This King has plaid them twenty ſuch Tricks; ſo that it was ſaid by an ingenious Man, that the Nobility in <hi>France</hi> was like a Copſ-wood to the King; which he cut down once in 6, or 7, or 9 years, according to his fancy.</p>
               <p>Then there are Taxes for the Homages of the Lands, holding directly of the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, beſides all other great Charges and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences on that Account.</p>
               <p>There are alſo Taxes now and then upon the <hi>Free Allodium,</hi> called <hi>Franc Alleu,</hi> which were ſo heavy two years ago, that a great many People did offer the ſaid Lands to the King, to be rid of the Tax, but they were rejected and forced to pay that extraordinary Tax, beſides the yearly Taxes, and thoſe very exceſſive too, which the ſaid Lands pay conſtantly.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe a Tax upon all Waters that water Lands; that is upon Rivers, Brooks and Rivulets which run along by the Lands of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Perſon: As alſo upon the Springs, and Pits, or other Waters, Ciſterns or Wells to water the Cattle, and in general upon all Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that may be uſeful; which ſtrange Tax was raiſed two years ago at a ſtrange rate.</p>
               <p>The Tax of the <hi>Franc fieſs,</hi> that is, of Fees poſſeſſed by thoſe who are not of the Nobility and Gentry. This is not paid yearly, but only
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60783:141"/> when the King pleaſes, and has been paid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times within this ten years laſt, tho' they had paid vaſt Sums for the Immunity from it for ever, and for the confirmation of the ſame, beſides the great <hi>Taxes</hi> on their <hi>Dove houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are alſo Taxes upon a great many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thoſe very heavy too, on pretence that in ſome places they have incroached upon the High-ways, if it be but half an Inch; and tho' 'tis commonly a falſe Accuſation, yet they muſt pay nevertheleſs, elſe the K. and the Farmers of Impoſitions would ruine 'em totally.</p>
               <p>They are obliged likewiſe to pay Taxes for the Iſlands in Rivers, tho' the Families who are in poſſeſſion, had enjoyed them for three or four Centuries, as their other Patrimonial Eſtates, and beſides the Tax for having enjoyed it ſo long, the King has diſpoiled the Proprietors of the ſaid Iſlands, great and ſmall, pretending that all the Rivers with all their Effects and Appurtenances do belong to him.</p>
               <p>There are extraordinary Taxes alſo upon all Water and Wind-mills, beſides the ordinary Taxes upon all Eſtates, on pretence that both the Wind and Waters belong to him.</p>
               <p>He hath alſo laid Taxes upon the new Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes either of Lands or Houſes, which obliges them to pay him a great part of the value.</p>
               <p>As alſo upon Eſtates ſold by Decree; the King has a ſhare in them, becauſe he pretends that the Buyer has a great penny worth of them.</p>
               <p>Then there's the Quint and Requint, which
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60783:141"/> is another extraordinary Tax upon Lands ſold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Tiers &amp; danger</hi> upon the Woods of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi> which is a ſtrange Tax that he has raiſed in <hi>Normandy.</hi> They found in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Charters that the old Dukes of <hi>Normandy,</hi> had part of their ancient Revenue ſettled upon the Woods of that Province, for which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors did pay a <hi>Tantum</hi> every year to their Duke for the maintaining of the Government, and paid no other Impoſitions beſides this. Now finding this in the Records, the King pretended to enjoy the ſame again, and demanded vaſt Sums of the Proprietors for the Arrears, for ſo many Centuries. A great many of the Nobility were ruined by it; I know one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>de Courtaumer's,</hi> who paid 80 thouſand Livers for this Tax, and all of them offered the Funds to the King for the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in vain: So that the K. got above 20 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions for that Tax out of that Province alone.</p>
               <p>Then there are other Taxes, called the <hi>Acapte, Infeodation</hi> of <hi>Accrve</hi> and <hi>Champart,</hi> and the <hi>Reunion</hi> of <hi>Crements, Sands</hi> and <hi>Gravels,</hi> which are ſome Reunions that are made to the King's Demains, of all Lands ſuppoſed to have been formed by the Gravel or Dirt, caſt up either by the Sea or Rivers; which ruines abundance of People, who had Lands, Houſes and Gardens there.</p>
               <p>There has been a Reunion alſo of all the Houſes and Gardens ſuppoſed to have been built too near the ancient Rampiers of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60783:142"/> Towns which were all fallen, and no body knew that they had ever been Rampiers. The King has confiſcated all ſuch Eſtates, or got Money for 'em.</p>
               <p>Then there is the Creation of Offices <hi>per force,</hi> with ſome ſmall wages ill paid.</p>
               <p>The aboliſhing of great part of the ſame Offices.</p>
               <p>The ſelling of the ſame again to others, without reimburſing the Perſons diſpoſſeſſed; when at the ſame time the old Offices are not worth the fourth nor ſixth part, nay, the tenth part of what they have been ſold for.</p>
               <p>This Creating and Aboliſhing of Offices has produced to the <hi>French</hi> King ſeveral hundreds of Millions, and would require a whole <hi>Book</hi> by it ſelf to give an Account of it.</p>
               <p>There has alſo been an <hi>Augmentation of Wages</hi> for all the old Offices, which one would think was very advantagious to them, but the contrary will appear thus; the King wanting Money had a mind to Tax them, ſome in 20, 30 or 40 thouſand Livers, more or leſs. Now the Council found out this way as leaſt odious, <hi>viz</hi> to augment their Wages, ſuppoſe a 1000 Livers <hi>per Annum,</hi> upon condition that they ſhould give him for it 20 thouſand Livers, more or leſs, as he thought fit. This is called by the ſpecious Name of <hi>Augmentation of Wages,</hi> tho' 'tis a perfect Robbery, for they are ill paid of their old and new VVages, and will at
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60783:142"/> laſt loſe their Offices for the moſt part, and never be reimburſed of any thing.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved that all thoſe new Officers ought by their agreement with the King to be free from almoſt all Taxes, which would be mighty oppreſſive to the reſt, but the King does not keep his word to them, nor can he do it, or elſe he ſhould get but little from the reſt.</p>
               <p>This innumerable multitude of Officers, and the great quantity of Coin and Plate, that they had hoarded up, has been a great Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource to the King for many years; So that he thought it would have been unexhauſtible, and that he might conquer all the world with it. This has been partly the cauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the Kingdom; But we may juſtly ſay, that his deſign of conquering others by ſo great a deſtruction of his own people, was juſt like that of a Man who ſhould ſell his Horſe to buy Hay.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a Creation of Maſter ſhips in all Trades and Handicrafts for Money.</p>
               <p>Extraordinary Taxes upon every Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Company of Handicrafts, and petty Tradeſmen, in all Cities, Towns, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs.</p>
               <p>There has been a Creation of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Officers amongſt them, whoſe functions are limited within the Society to which they do belong; beſides other Offices which they had before, or might have afterwards for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:60783:143"/>
               <p>Then there are Taxes upon all thoſe who have been in any Commiſſion, great or ſmall, about any function relating to the Finances, and upon all their Charges and Offices.</p>
               <p>There has been an increaſing of Wages to them alſo, as well as to all Officers of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Civil Government, by forcing them to give the King great Sums of Money.</p>
               <p>There are alſo other Impoſitions upon the Officers of Judicature, and Civil Government.</p>
               <p>There is the Price of the Valuation.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Marc d'or.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are alſo extraordinary Taxes impoſed now and then on all thoſe who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned either in the general or particular Farms of the Impoſitions, or in any other wherein 'tis ſuppoſed they get Money; this preſent King has got from ſuch Perſons at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times above 200 Millions of Livers, and 'tis probable that aſſoon as the Peace is concluded he will ruine them all, for he cannot do it now, becauſe they advance him Money.</p>
               <p>There are alſo extraordinary Taxes upon all others, who are ſuppoſed to be in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, tho' really ruined, and which does in effect ruine them totally.</p>
               <p>And then there's to pay for all Officers created,</p>
               <p>The 2 pence in the Liver.</p>
               <p>The Right of the Seal.</p>
               <p>The Right of Control.</p>
               <p>The Right of Enregiſtring.</p>
               <p>The Right of the Oath.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:60783:143"/>
               <p>Loans forced upon thouſands and thouſands of People.</p>
               <p>Then there is the Loan, called <hi>Preſt,</hi> to be admitted to the Annual or <hi>Paulette,</hi> ſo called from the Name of the firſt inventor; it is a Sum of Money which the Officers of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give yearly to the King, to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Hereditary Poſſeſſion of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and if ſo be they did not pay it exactly, their Office returns to the King after their Death. Commonly this <hi>Tax</hi> is as much as the Wages the King allows them, with this difference, that the King pays them very ill, and that what he is owing to them is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted upon what they owe him, and they are proſecuted when they do not pay, tho' he does not pay them himſelf.</p>
               <p>They have yet ſeveral other <hi>Taxes</hi> to pay from time to time, and are obliged to ſuffer ſeveral diminutions in their Wages yearly, for the Superior Companies have but three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their VVages, the Inferiour only two, and the <hi>Comptables,</hi> ſo called, oftentimes but one, and thoſe VVages are alſo inconſiderable; And they are obnoxious now and then to dreadful extraordinary Taxes, and to ſome Fixations of their Offices, which now and then makes all their Offices fall one half of a ſudden, and very often they are caſhier'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reimburſement.</p>
               <p>The Reunion to the Kings Demain, of the Rents alienated on the Town Houſes, that is
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60783:144"/> to ſay, the King turns Bankrupt when he pleaſes, and he takes away when he pleaſes, without reimburſing any Body, all that which did belong to Commonalties, Towns and to a great number of private Men, which had lent him Sums of Money in the Exigencies of the State, and to whom the Rent of them was paid upon the Revenues which the King got from thoſe Cities and Towns.</p>
               <p>He Reunites, I ſay, all ſuch Rents to his Demain and diſpoils his Creditors. My own Family has loſt 40 thouſand Livers by that way. He Reunites alſo to the ſame Demain ſeveral other Rights that have been poſſeſſed, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by Cities, Corporations or Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, time out of Mind, as the Right of Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in ſome Foreſts, ſome Paſtures, VVoods, Rivers, Heaths, Moraſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has alſo appropriated to himſelf the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of a great many Hoſpitals in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as alſo all the Funds belonging to Towns, whoſe Revenue did help towards the Repairing of the High-ways and Streets, and the Publick Buildings.</p>
               <p>He has alſo exacted ſometimes from ſeveral Perſons great Sums of Money, under pretence of ſetting up the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt-India Companies,</hi> which Sums have been loſt to the lenders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he applied them to his own uſes.</p>

               <p>'Tis true thoſe Demains are of an inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Revenue,</hi> but the Reunions he has made to them, and the ſeveral new Impoſitions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to which he has given the Name of the <hi>Kings Demain,</hi> make it a Farm very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <p>The Caſual Parties, this Farm has produced more Money to the King theſe eight laſt years of the War, than a great many other ordinary Impoſitions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Ban and Arrierban upon the Nobility, upon the Citizens of all the Cities called <hi>Free,</hi> upon the <hi>Mareſhalſeas;</hi> by this way many thouſands are compelled to ſerve in the Armies, &amp; to equip 'emſelves, who have not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to do it, or are Lame, or Old, or Widows, or Heyreſſes; all thoſe who cannot go, muſt give the King every one 50 Piſtols to equip a Man in their room.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:60783:146"/>
               <p>He has ſince this War forced the City of <hi>Paris</hi> to yield him the Sum of Money raiſed yearly for Lanterns and Scavengers, and took upon him the care of that Affair, obliging the People to advance him the Money neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for doing the ſame for 20 years, but 'tis thought he will not keep his word, becauſe he is not able to perform it if he would.</p>
               <p>In every Province, nay, in every Town al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt there are Impoſitions unknown to other Towns and Provinces. But the great ones are general, except in the Provinces that have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, who have their own Methods, but are almoſt as much ruined as the reſt, for they are Slaves as well as others.</p>
               <p>Some of thoſe Impoſitions afore named may ſeem to have been repeated twice, but the Reader is deſired to obſerve that tho' ſeveral of the Impoſitions have the ſame Name, yet they are different in Nature.</p>
               <p>The Capitation was ſet up about 3 years ago, from which they expected a great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, but found it came much ſhort of what they expected, tho' all the Subjects did pay it without any exception, nay, even the Foot Soldiers paid their 20 pences <hi>per annum</hi> a-piece. This impoſition has no doubt taught them, that there was much leſs People in the Kingdom than they thought.</p>
               <p>This Tax is raiſed in many Places by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, who have orders to quarter Soldiers upon all thoſe who cannot pay it, and at leaſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60783:146"/> to pay for them, unleſs they will be quartered upon themſelves. They have doubled and trebled it ſince the firſt year that it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and do force as I have ſaid already, the Friends of the Deceaſed to pay for thoſe who died ſince. It is alſo to be obſerved, that in the Kings Tariff about the Capitation, a Man who had three or four Titles, as that of <hi>Citizen,</hi> and <hi>Gentleman,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould pay only for one of them, but in the Execution they made them pay for all their Titles. And ſince they have laid a Tax upon all thoſe who aſſume the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Marquis, Count, Viſcount, Barons, Knight, Meſſire, Eſquire, Nobleman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and upon their Coats of Arms, from which they expect great Sums, but all in vain, for all ſorts of conditions of Men are exhauſted and ruined.</p>
               <p>If there was ſuch a thing in <hi>France</hi> as the Taxes that are raiſed here in every Pariſh for the relief of the Poor, the King ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate them to himſelf, as he has done with the Revenue of almoſt all the Hoſpitals in the Kingdom. The new Converts have alſo paid in particular ſeveral great Taxes, under divers pretences, either becauſe they did not go to the Popiſh Churches, or did not ſend their Children to the Catechiſm of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The King has cauſed in the year of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the Corn, Wine and Fruits to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Farmers and Gentlemens Houſes to his Magazines <hi>per Force,</hi> without paying any thing for them, or diſcharging them of part of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60783:147"/> their Taxes. He has forced the Shopkeepers and Tradeſmen in the Garriſons to give upon truſt to his Officers and Soldiers what they wanted, without paying any thing. 'Tis to be obſerved further, that this King has erected or ſet up lately Office-Houſes in all Pariſhes, and Officers, who bought ſuch Places, for the keeping of all Cattle and Houſhold-goods executed for the Kings Taxes; the Collectors muſt execute all without Mercy, or elſe they ſhall periſh in the Goal; The Cattle or Goods executed are to be ſold at an appointed day, and commonly for leſs than half of the value, and upon the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Officer of the Office has 2 pence in the Liver, beſides the charges of the Bailiffs who did execute, and of all the proceedings done in marked Paper. All this was prognoſticated to Mankind, by this Kings being born with teeth, whereby he did devour all his nurſing Mothers Breaſts, which did ſignifie to the world that he would devour his own Country.</p>
               <p>It is alſo obſervable that in all thoſe Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions there is not one that concerns the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. But yet they have agreed, as I ſaid, to pay 20 Millions of Livers for 5 years of the Capitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides what they paid under the name of <hi>Decimes,</hi> which amounted to 4 or 5 Million.</p>
               <p>Here I cannot but take notice of what <hi>Fra Paolo</hi> has obſerved in his Hiſtory of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent, viz.</hi> that in the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God as Miniſters of the Church, who
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60783:147"/> made the twelfth part of all the Nation, had for its maintenance but the 10 part of the Fruits of the Earth, whereas in the Roman Church the Clergy who does not make commonly in every Nation under the Popes Yoke, one with another, above the 30th or 40th part of it, poſſeſſes the half of all the Revenues and above.</p>
               <p>The French Clergy in general took always great care to conceal the quantity of their Revenues, for fear that the other Members of the Nation, ſhould make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints when they ſaw them diſcharged from all Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, while they who are uſeful to the Nation, are ſo abominably oppreſſed with Taxes. This is the reaſon why the Authors ſpeak ſo differently of the French Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys Revenues; ſome ſaying they poſſeſs 3 parts in 5 of all the Eſtates in the Kingdom, others 2 parts in 5, others 7 parts of twelve; And I took the <hi>Medium</hi> of thoſe Suppoſitions, that is, the half of all the Eſtates in the Kingdom. They have another great Reſſource in their Foreſts of High-Trees, called <hi>Bois de Futaye,</hi> which they have not been obliged to ſell for want, as other Subjects have been; 'tis thought the 2 thirds of ſuch Woods in the Kingdom belong to them; beſides that, they are not indebted as others are; and then ſome Orders of the Clergy, as the Jeſuits and Fathers <hi>de l'Oratoire,</hi> have great Profits from their Schools and Boarders, for almoſt all the Colledges in the Kingdom are in the hands of them, or of ſome other Prieſts, and, as I ſaid, all thoſe Sects of Men may retrench their numbers without any inconvenience, and be ſo much the richer.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the Vexations committed in the raiſing of all the ſaid Taxes, are almoſt as chargeable to the People as the Taxes themſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add this, becauſe I perceive this Book grows too big, that all thoſe Impoſitions and a great many more were for the moſt part comprehended under 7 general Farms, <hi>viz.</hi> under the name of <hi>Taille, Gabelle,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60783:148"/> Aides, Douane,</hi> the five great <hi>Farms,</hi> the <hi>Caſual Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,</hi> the <hi>Demain,</hi> and each of them in ſeveral Inferior Branches, which were all let out apart to ſeveral gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Farmers, which did appoint under themſelves other particular Farmers, which did draw from the People as much as they could, having a Leaſe for 3, or 5, or 7 years more or leſs, and did advance vaſt Sums of Money to the King; they took them formerly at <hi>forfait,</hi> as they call it, that is, they paid ſo much yearly whether there was profit to be made by 'em or no; but now, becauſe of the Deſtruction of the Kingdom, they take them only as Stewards who are only to give an Account of what they receive; But ſometimes to impoſe upon the People and Foreign Nations, and make 'em believe that the Publick Revenues are not ſo much diminiſhed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to maintain the Kings Credit, the King obliges 'em to draw up Leaſes with him, by which it ſeems they pay almoſt as much as formerly, but they get a Counter letter from him or his Miniſters for their ſecurity; and tho' they are but Stewards and Adminiſtrators, yet they get ſtill vaſt Eſtates, tho' not ſo great as formerly, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Money to the King ſtill, which is a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him.</p>
               <p>A great Volume in <hi>Folio</hi> would not be ſufficient to give a perfect Account of all what relates to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and extraordinary Impoſitions and Taxes; and beſides there are ſo many Additions and Changes every year, that 'tis as with the City of <hi>London,</hi> of which 'tis a hard matter to make a good Map, becauſe of the Additions, Alterations and Changes made every year.—I muſt yet add this, that notwithſtanding the great Ruine of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe is able yet, by the Deſpotical. Author ity of her Monarch, to do after the Peace, which ſeem to be in a forwardneſs, horrid Miſchiefs, which I pray God to avert from us.</p>
